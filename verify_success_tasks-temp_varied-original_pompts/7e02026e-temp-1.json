Based on the pattern, these 0s should change to 3s.\n\n2.  **Other regions**:\n    *   The vertical corridor around `(6,4)` to `(9,5)` is bounded by 8s on the sides but is open (leaky) at the bottom (connected to the boundary via row 11 and 12). In training examples (e.g., Example 0), leaky regions did not fill completely, or only filled in specific \"room\" shapes like crosses. This region is a \"corridor\" rather than a \"room\", and thus is less likely to fill.\n    *   Other areas are clearly open or not enclosed.\n\nTherefore, the only transformation is to change the 0s at `(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)` to 3s.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nRow 3 changes from `[8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]` to `[8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0]`.\nAll other rows remain identical to the input.\n\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]",

        "raw_text": "Based on the patterns observed in the training examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Valid Centers:** Scan the input grid to find all cells `(r, c)` that contain `0` and whose four immediate orthogonal neighbors (top `(r-1, c)`, bottom `(r+1, c)`, left `(r, c-1)`, and right `(r, c+1)`) also contain `0`.\n2.  **Create Diamonds:** For every such valid center found, create a \"diamond\" shape of `3`s (green) in the output grid. This diamond consists of the center cell itself and its four neighbors.\n3.  **Merge:** If multiple diamonds overlap, the `3`s merge. Any cell that is part of at least one such diamond becomes `3` in the output. All other cells retain their original values from the input (`8` or `0`).\n\n**Applying the rule to the Test Input:**\n\nWe identify the following valid centers (coordinates are 0-indexed, `(row, column)`):\n\n*   **Center at (2, 5):**\n    *   Input values at (2,5) and its neighbors (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6) are all `0`.\n    *   **Action:** Set (2,5), (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6) to `3`.\n\n*   **Center at (5, 9):**\n    *   Input values at (5,9) and its neighbors (4,9), (6,9), (5,8), (5,10) are all `0`.\n    *   **Action:** Set (5,9), (4,9), (6,9), (5,8), (5,10) to `3`.\n\n*   **Center at (9, 1):**\n    *   Input values at (9,1) and its neighbors (8,1), (10,1), (9,0), (9,2) are all `0`.\n    *   **Action:** Set (9,1), (8,1), (10,1), (9,0), (9,2) to `3`.\n\n*   **Center at (9, 2):**\n    *   Input values at (9,2) and its neighbors (8,2), (10,2), (9,1), (9,3) are all `0`.\n    *   **Action:** Set (9,2), (8,2), (10,2), (9,1), (9,3) to `3`.\n    *   *Note:* The diamonds for (9,1) and (9,2) overlap and merge.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** Index 5 becomes `3`.\n*   **Row 2:** Indices 4, 5, 6 become `3`.\n*   **Row 3:** Index 5 becomes `3`.\n*   **Row 4:** Index 9 becomes `3`.\n*   **Row 5:** Indices 8, 9, 10 become `3`.\n*   **Row 6:** Index 9 becomes `3`.\n*   **Row 8:** Indices 1, 2 become `3` (Neighbors of centers (9,1) and (9,2)).\n*   **Row 9:** Indices 0, 1, 2, 3 become `3` (Neighbors and centers).\n*   **Row 10:** Indices 1, 2 become `3` (Neighbors of centers (9,1) and (9,2)).\n\nAll other cells remain as in the input.\n\n```json\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]\n```",
