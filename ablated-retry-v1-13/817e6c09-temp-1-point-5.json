Blocks at corners `(0,11)` and `(5,15)` also become `8`. A separate cluster `(3,13) -> (4,10) -> (5,6)` (diagonal from top-right to bottom-left) remains `2`. The rule appears to prioritize the \"dominant\" or \"longest\" diagonal chain and corner outliers as `8`.\n*   **Example 1:** Corner/Edge blocks `(0,12)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,7)` become `8`.

The top-left block `(1,0)` remains `2`.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\nThe consistent pattern is that **blocks forming the most coherent linear or diagonal chain** are transformed into `8`s (Cyan). Blocks that are **scattered**, **internal**, or form **shorter/secondary chains** remain `2`s (Red). Corner/Edge blocks that align with the general flow of the dominant chain are often included.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe input grid contains several $2 \\times 2$ blocks of `2`s.

Their relative positions do not form a straight line. `(5,0)` to `(2,2)` is steep. `(2,2)` to `(4,4)` is a short diagonal ($+2, +2$). `(4,4)` to `(1,7)` is backwards ($ -3, +3$). This group is scattered.\n*   **Right Group:** `(1,13)`, `(4,11)`, `(5,8)`.\n    *   From `(1,13)` to `(4,11)`: Down 3 rows, Left 2 cols.\n    *   From `(4,11)` to `(5,8)`: Down 1 row, Left 3 cols.\n    *   Visually, these three blocks form a descending diagonal line on the right side of the grid. This is the **dominant chain**.\n\nFollowing the logic from the training examples (especially Example 2 and Example 0), the blocks in this dominant chain `(1,13), (4,11), (5,8)` will be converted to `8`s. The remaining blocks `(1,7), (2,2), (4,4), (5,0)` will remain `2`.\n\n**Construction of Final Output:**\n*   **Change to 8:** Blocks starting at `(1,13)`, `(4,11)`, `(5,8)`.\n*   **Keep as 2:** Blocks starting at `(1,7)`, `(2,2)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,0)`.\n\n**Coordinates of blocks to be colored `8`:**\n1.
