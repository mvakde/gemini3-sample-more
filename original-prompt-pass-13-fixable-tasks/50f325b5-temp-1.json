This matches the target exactly.\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    Replace the '3's at the identified coordinates with '8's.\n\n    *   Row 13: Indices 2, 3, 15 become 8.\n    *   Row 14: Indices 3, 4, 15, 16 become 8.\n    *   Row 15: Index 16 becomes 8.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   **Row 13 Input:** `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]`\n    *   Change indices 2, 3, 15.\n    *   **Row 13 Output:** `[3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]`\n\n*   **Row 14 Input:** `[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3]`\n    *   Change indices 3, 4, 15, 16.\n    *   **Row 14 Output:** `[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8]`\n\n*   **Row 15 Input:** `[3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]`\n    *   Change index 16.\n    *   **Row 15 Output:** `[3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 8]`\n\nAll other rows remain identical to the input.\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 8]]",

Then, find all occurrences of the digit `3` that form the same shape (which can be rotated 90, 180, or 270 degrees). Change the digits in these matching shapes from `3` to `8`. Any other `3`s that do not form the shape (or form the reflected shape, if not equivalent by rotation) are left unchanged. Extra connected `3`s that are not part of the matching shape are ignored.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify 8-shape:**\n    The `8`s are located at coordinates (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), and (6,3).\n    The shape is a vertical \"step\" or \"S\" shape:\n    ```\n    8 .\n    8 8\n    . 8\n    ```\n    Relative coordinates: `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)`.\n\n2.  **Find matching 3-shapes:**\n    We scan the grid for `3`s forming this shape or its rotations.\n    The rotations are:\n    *   Vertical S (0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0): Same as original.\n    *   Horizontal S (90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0):\n        ```\n        . 3 3\n        3 3 .\n        ```\n\n    We found one matching group of `3`s in the Vertical S orientation:\n    *   (9,13)\n    *   (10,13)\n    *   (10,14)\n    *   (11,14)\n    \n    Checking the values:\n    *   Input Row 9, Col 13 is `3`.\n    *   Input Row 10, Col 13 is `3`.\n    *   Input Row 10, Col 14 is `3`.\n    *   Input Row 11, Col 14 is `3`.\n    *   The cell (11,13) is also `3`, but it is outside the mapped shape (it would correspond to (2,0), which is empty in the pattern). As observed in Example 0, extra attached `3`s are ignored.\n\n    No other valid matches were found (a potential horizontal match at rows 13-14 failed due to a `0` where a `3` was needed).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    Change the values at (9,13), (10,13), (10,14), and (11,14) from `3` to `8`.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\nRow 9: `... 2, 3, 0, 7, 8, 0, 7, 3` (Index 13 changed to 8)\nRow 10: `... 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2` (Indices 13, 14 changed to 8)\nRow 11: `... 2, 3, 3, 8, 3` (Index 14 changed to 8)\n\nOutput:\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 8, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]"

        "raw_text": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the pattern is to identify the connected shape formed by the digit `8` in the input grid. Then, find all occurrences of the digit `3` that form the same shape (which can be rotated 90, 180, or 270 degrees). Change the digits in these matching shapes from `3` to `8`. Any other `3`s that do not form the shape (or form the reflected shape, if not equivalent by rotation) are left unchanged. Extra connected `3`s that are not part of the matching shape are ignored.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify 8-shape:**\n    The `8`s are located at coordinates (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), and (6,3).\n    The shape is a vertical \"step\" or \"S\" shape:\n    ```\n    8 .\n    8 8\n    . 8\n    ```\n    Relative coordinates: `(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)`.\n\n2.  **Find matching 3-shapes:**\n    We scan the grid for `3`s forming this shape or its rotations.\n    The rotations are:\n    *   Vertical S (0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0): Same as original.\n    *   Horizontal S (90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0):\n        ```\n        . 3 3\n        3 3 .\n        ```\n\n    We found one matching group of `3`s in the Vertical S orientation:\n    *   (9,13)\n    *   (10,13)\n    *   (10,14)\n    *   (11,14)\n    \n    Checking the values:\n    *   Input Row 9, Col 13 is `3`.\n    *   Input Row 10, Col 13 is `3`.\n    *   Input Row 10, Col 14 is `3`.\n    *   Input Row 11, Col 14 is `3`.\n    *   The cell (11,13) is also `3`, but it is outside the mapped shape (it would correspond to (2,0), which is empty in the pattern). As observed in Example 0, extra attached `3`s are ignored.\n\n    No other valid matches were found (a potential horizontal match at rows 13-14 failed due to a `0` where a `3` was needed).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    Change the values at (9,13), (10,13), (10,14), and (11,14) from `3` to `8`.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\nRow 9: `... 2, 3, 0, 7, 8, 0, 7, 3` (Index 13 changed to 8)\nRow 10: `... 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2` (Indices 13, 14 changed to 8)\nRow 11: `... 2, 3, 3, 8, 3` (Index 14 changed to 8)\n\nOutput:\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 8, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]",

              "content": "Based on the patterns observed in the training examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Template Shapes:** Locate all connected components of the color 8 in the input grid. These shapes serve as \"templates\".\n    *   In Example 0, the template was a T-shape (size 5).\n    *   In Example 1, the templates were an L-shape (size 3) and a Single cell (size 1).\n    *   In Example 2, the template was a T-shape (size 4).\n\n2.  **Find Matching Patterns:** Identify connected components of the color 3. Check if these components (or subsets of them) form shapes that match the template(s) or valid sub-templates.\n    *   Rotation and reflection of the templates are allowed.\n    *   There is a minimum size constraint for a match, likely inferred from the templates or observed data (e.g., size $\\ge$ 3, unless a smaller template explicitly exists). In Example 2, an L-shape (size 3) subset of a larger component was changed to 8s because it matched a sub-structure of the T-shape template (size 4), while pairs and singles did not change.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Change the color of the matching 3s to 8s. If a component contains a matching shape as a subset (e.g., an L-shape within a square), only the matching subset is changed.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate 8s (Template):**\n    *   Row 4, Index 2: `8`\n    *   Row 5, Indices 2, 3: `8, 8`\n    *   Row 6, Index 3: `8`\n    *   Shape: A 'Z' or 'S' tetromino (size 4).\n        ```\n        8\n        8 8\n          8\n        ```\n    *   Valid sub-templates: Since the Z-shape contains an L-shape (size 3), and previous examples show size-3 sub-matches are valid, L-shapes of 3s are targets.\n\n2.  **Locate 3s and Match:**\n    *   **Group 1 (Rows 2-3):**\n        *   R2 indices 12, 13 are `3, 3`.\n        *   R3 index 12 is `3`.\n        *   Formation:\n            ```\n            3 3  (R2)\n            3    (R3)\n            ```\n        *   This is an L-shape. It matches the sub-template.\n        *   Action: Change (2,12), (2,13), (3,12) to `8`.\n\n    *   **Group 2 (Rows 10-11):**\n        *   R10 indices 13, 14 are `3, 3`.\n        *   R11 indices 13, 14 are `3, 3`.\n        *   Formation: A 2x2 square of 3s.\n        *   This contains an L-shape (subset). Following Example 2's logic, we convert an L-shape subset.\n        *   Action: Change (10,13), (10,14), (11,13) to `8` (forming a top-left L), leaving (11,14) as `3`.\n\n    *   **Other Groups:**\n        *   Various lines of 3s and singles exist, but none form an L-shape (requires a \"corner\"). Pairs are too small (min size 3).\n        *   Component at (12,4)-(12,5) and (13,0)-(13,4) are not connected (0 at (13,4)). (12,4) and (12,5) form a pair. (13,0) to (13,3) form a line. No L-shapes found.\n\n**Constructing Output:**\n\n*   **Row 2:** `... 0, 3, 3, 0 ...` at indices 11-14 becomes `... 0, 8, 8, 0 ...`\n*   **Row 3:** `... 4, 3, 2, 3 ...` at indices 11-14 becomes `... 4, 8, 2, 3 ...` (Index 12 changed).\n*   **Row 10:** `... 0, 3, 3, 7, 2` at indices 12-16 becomes `... 0, 8, 8, 7, 2`.\n*   **Row 11:** `... 2, 3, 3, 0, 3` at indices 12-16 becomes `... 2, 8, 3, 0, 3`. (Index 13 changed, 14 remains 3).\n\nAll other rows remain identical to the input.\n\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 8, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]"

        "raw_text": "Based on the patterns observed in the training examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Template Shapes:** Locate all connected components of the color 8 in the input grid. These shapes serve as \"templates\".\n    *   In Example 0, the template was a T-shape (size 5).\n    *   In Example 1, the templates were an L-shape (size 3) and a Single cell (size 1).\n    *   In Example 2, the template was a T-shape (size 4).\n\n2.  **Find Matching Patterns:** Identify connected components of the color 3. Check if these components (or subsets of them) form shapes that match the template(s) or valid sub-templates.\n    *   Rotation and reflection of the templates are allowed.\n    *   There is a minimum size constraint for a match, likely inferred from the templates or observed data (e.g., size $\\ge$ 3, unless a smaller template explicitly exists). In Example 2, an L-shape (size 3) subset of a larger component was changed to 8s because it matched a sub-structure of the T-shape template (size 4), while pairs and singles did not change.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Change the color of the matching 3s to 8s. If a component contains a matching shape as a subset (e.g., an L-shape within a square), only the matching subset is changed.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate 8s (Template):**\n    *   Row 4, Index 2: `8`\n    *   Row 5, Indices 2, 3: `8, 8`\n    *   Row 6, Index 3: `8`\n    *   Shape: A 'Z' or 'S' tetromino (size 4).\n        ```\n        8\n        8 8\n          8\n        ```\n    *   Valid sub-templates: Since the Z-shape contains an L-shape (size 3), and previous examples show size-3 sub-matches are valid, L-shapes of 3s are targets.\n\n2.  **Locate 3s and Match:**\n    *   **Group 1 (Rows 2-3):**\n        *   R2 indices 12, 13 are `3, 3`.\n        *   R3 index 12 is `3`.\n        *   Formation:\n            ```\n            3 3  (R2)\n            3    (R3)\n            ```\n        *   This is an L-shape. It matches the sub-template.\n        *   Action: Change (2,12), (2,13), (3,12) to `8`.\n\n    *   **Group 2 (Rows 10-11):**\n        *   R10 indices 13, 14 are `3, 3`.\n        *   R11 indices 13, 14 are `3, 3`.\n        *   Formation: A 2x2 square of 3s.\n        *   This contains an L-shape (subset). Following Example 2's logic, we convert an L-shape subset.\n        *   Action: Change (10,13), (10,14), (11,13) to `8` (forming a top-left L), leaving (11,14) as `3`.\n\n    *   **Other Groups:**\n        *   Various lines of 3s and singles exist, but none form an L-shape (requires a \"corner\"). Pairs are too small (min size 3).\n        *   Component at (12,4)-(12,5) and (13,0)-(13,4) are not connected (0 at (13,4)). (12,4) and (12,5) form a pair. (13,0) to (13,3) form a line. No L-shapes found.\n\n**Constructing Output:**\n\n*   **Row 2:** `... 0, 3, 3, 0 ...` at indices 11-14 becomes `... 0, 8, 8, 0 ...`\n*   **Row 3:** `... 4, 3, 2, 3 ...` at indices 11-14 becomes `... 4, 8, 2, 3 ...` (Index 12 changed).\n*   **Row 10:** `... 0, 3, 3, 7, 2` at indices 12-16 becomes `... 0, 8, 8, 7, 2`.\n*   **Row 11:** `... 2, 3, 3, 0, 3` at indices 12-16 becomes `... 2, 8, 3, 0, 3`. (Index 13 changed, 14 remains 3).\n\nAll other rows remain identical to the input.\n\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 8, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]",
