There is a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output. Now the test input differs slightly from the train input. Ideally a generalised transformation should have been applied to the test input to generate the test output. But the puzzle solver got confused and made a mistake. Figure out the mistake and generate the correct test output by correcting the mistake and applying the generalised transformation.\n\nRespond in the format of the output grids\n\n--Training

              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the block of 8s**: Locate the rectangular block of `8`s in the input grid. Let's say this block spans rows `r_start` to `r_end` and columns `c_start` to `c_end`.\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: The output grid has dimensions `(r_end - r_start + 1)` rows by `(c_end - c_start + 1)` columns.\n3.  **Map Rows**: For each row `i` in the output grid (corresponding to row `r = r_start + i` in the input), the content is derived from the input row `target_r = 31 - r`.\n4.  **Extract Content**:\n    *   If the `target_r` row **does not** contain `8`s at the target columns (`c_start` to `c_end`), simply extract the values from `grid[target_r][c_start : c_end + 1]`.\n    *   If the `target_r` row **does** contain `8`s (which happens when the block of 8s is vertically centered or overlaps with its reflection), the values are hidden. In the Test Example, the `8`s are at the left edge (columns 0-2). The pattern observed in the \"Wrong Output\" (specifically rows 1 and 2 matching the values adjacent to the 8s) suggests that when the target is obscured by 8s, we should take the values **immediately adjacent** to the 8s block in the source row.

Let's say this block spans rows `r_start` to `r_end` and columns `c_start` to `c_end`.\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: The output grid has dimensions `(r_end - r_start + 1)` rows by `(c_end - c_start + 1)` columns.\n3.  **Map Rows**: For each row `i` in the output grid (corresponding to row `r = r_start + i` in the input), the content is derived from the input row `target_r = 31 - r`.\n4.  **Extract Content**:\n    *   If the `target_r` row **does not** contain `8`s at the target columns (`c_start` to `c_end`), simply extract the values from `grid[target_r][c_start : c_end + 1]`.\n    *   If the `target_r` row **does** contain `8`s (which happens when the block of 8s is vertically centered or overlaps with its reflection), the values are hidden.
