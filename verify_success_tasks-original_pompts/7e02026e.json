              "content": "The transformation rule identified is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Seeds\"**: Search the grid for `0`s that are sandwiched directly between `8`s in either the horizontal (`8 0 8`) or vertical (`8` above, `8` below) direction. These are the starting points for the `3`s.\n2.  **Expand**: From each seed, expand into adjacent rows (or columns) to fill `0`s with `3`s, forming a shape (typically a cross, diamond, or pyramid) that fits within the \"cavity\" formed by `8`s.\n    *   The shape expands from the seed into the open direction (where there is a `0` neighbor).\n    *   The width of the filled area typically increases by 1 on each side (e.g., width 1 -> width 3) if the space allows (bounded by `8`s or grid edges).\n    *   The expansion stops when it hits `8`s or the boundary of the cavity.\n\n**Applying this to the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Cluster 1 (Bottom Left):**\n    *   **Seed:** (7, 2) is `8 0 8` (Row 7: `...8, 0, 8...`). It opens downwards.\n    *   **Row 7:** Cell (7, 2) becomes `3`.\n    *   **Row 8:** Expands to width 3 centered at 2 -> indices 1, 2, 3. Input (8, 3) is `8`. So (8, 1) and (8, 2) become `3`.\n    *   **Row 9:** Expands to width 3 centered at 2 -> indices 1, 2, 3. Input (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3) are `0`. All become `3`.\n    *   **Row 10:** Expands/Continues. Input (10, 3) is `8`. So (10, 1), (10, 2) become `3`.\n    *   **Row 11:** Input (11, 2) is `8`. Expansion stops.\n\n*   **Cluster 2 (Middle):**\n    *   **Seed:** (4, 6) is `8 0 8` (Row 4: `...8, 0, 8...`). It opens downwards.\n    *   **Row 4:** Cell (4, 6) becomes `3`.\n    *   **Row 5:** Expands to width 3 centered at 6 -> indices 5, 6, 7. Input (5, 5-7) are `0`. All become `3`.\n    *   **Row 6:** Input (6, 6) is `8`. Expansion stops.\n\n*   **Cluster 3 (Top Right):**\n    *   **Seeds:** (3, 8) is a vertical seed (`8` at (2,8) and (4,8)). (4, 9) is a horizontal seed (`8 0 8`).\n    *   **Row 3:** Cells (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10) become `3`. Bounded by `8` at (3, 7) and (3, 11).\n    *   **Row 4:** Cell (4, 9) becomes `3` (Seed). Neighbors (4, 8) and (4, 10) are `8`.\n    *   **Row 5:** Expands downwards from (4, 9). Width 3 centered at 9 -> indices 8, 9, 10. All become `3`.\n    *   **Row 6:** Continues. Input (6, 8) is `8`. Indices 9, 10 become `3`.\n    *   **Row 7:** Input (7, 9) is `8`. Expansion stops.\n\n**Final Output Construction:**\n\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], \n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0], \n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], \n [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], \n [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 0], \n [0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], \n [0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], \n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]\n\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 0], [0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]"
