        "raw_text": "The pattern identified in the training examples is to locate every `0` that is the center of a \"plus sign\" of `0`s. A plus sign consists of a center cell `(r, c)` and its four cardinal neighbors `(r-1, c)`, `(r+1, c)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r, c+1)`. If all five of these cells contain `0` in the input grid, then in the output grid, all five of these cells are changed to `3`.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input:\n\n1.  **Identify Centers:**\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find the following cells `(r, c)` where `grid[r][c] == 0` and all 4 neighbors are `0`:\n        *   **(2, 5)**: Neighbors (1, 5), (3, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6) are all `0`.\n        *   **(5, 9)**: Neighbors (4, 9), (6, 9), (5, 8), (5, 10) are all `0`.\n        *   **(9, 1)**: Neighbors (8, 1), (10, 1), (9, 0), (9, 2) are all `0`.\n        *   **(9, 2)**: Neighbors (8, 2), (10, 2), (9, 1), (9, 3) are all `0`.\n\n2.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   For center **(2, 5)**, change (2, 5) and its neighbors to `3`.\n        *   Cells: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5).\n    *   For center **(5, 9)**, change (5, 9) and its neighbors to `3`.\n        *   Cells: (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 9).\n    *   For center **(9, 1)**, change (9, 1) and its neighbors to `3`.\n        *   Cells: (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (10, 1).\n    *   For center **(9, 2)**, change (9, 2) and its neighbors to `3`.\n        *   Cells: (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2).\n\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   Start with the input grid.\n    *   Update the identified cells to `3`.\n\n    *   **Row 1**: `... 0, 3, 8 ...` (Index 5 changed)\n    *   **Row 2**: `... 8, 3, 3, 3, 8 ...` (Indices 4, 5, 6 changed)\n    *   **Row 3**: `... 8, 3, 8 ...` (Index 5 changed)\n    *   **Row 4**: `... 8, 3, 8 ...` (Index 9 changed)\n    *   **Row 5**: `... 0, 3, 3, 3, 0 ...` (Indices 8, 9, 10 changed)\n    *   **Row 6**: `... 8, 3, 0 ...` (Index 9 changed)\n    *   **Row 8**: `0, 3, 3, 8 ...` (Indices 1, 2 changed)\n    *   **Row 9**: `3, 3, 3, 3, 8 ...` (Indices 0, 1, 2, 3 changed)\n    *   **Row 10**: `0, 3, 3, 8 ...` (Indices 1, 2 changed)\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]",
