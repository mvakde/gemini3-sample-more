These seeds effectively become part of the wall structure.\n    *   **Space Fillers**: Seeds that are not adjacent to any wall cell, or Wall Masters that are not Pure Walls.\n3.  **Color Walls**:\n    *   The input 1s (walls) are colored by the **Wall Master** seeds.\n    *   Each connected component of walls takes the color of the nearest Wall Master (using path distance through the walls).\n    *   If a component contains a **Pure Wall** seed, the entire component takes the color of that seed.\n4.  **Color Space**:\n    *   The input 0s (space) are filled by the **Space Filler** seeds (and non-Pure Wall Masters).\n    *   This is a multi-source flood fill (Voronoi tessellation) using Manhattan distance.\n    *   The walls (now colored) act as barriers.\n    *   **Pure Wall** seeds do *not* fill space; they only color the walls.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds**:\n    *   5 at (0,1): Space Filler.\n    *   3 at (0,3): Wall Master (adjacent to (1,3)). Not Pure (does not close a cycle).\n    *   7 at (4,2): Wall Master (adjacent to (3,2)). Not Pure.\n    *   8 at (5,9): Space Filler (inside the loop).\n    *   6 at (7,11): **Pure Wall**. It connects (6,11) and (8,11), which are connected via the large loop of walls.\n    *   4 at (11,3): Space Filler.\n\n*   **Wall Coloring**:\n    *   **Component A** (Left): Includes (1,3), (2,2)-(2,3), (3,0)-(3,2). Touched by 3 and 7.\n        *   (1,3), (2,3) are closer to 3 -> Color 3.\n        *   (2,2), (3,0)-(3,2) are closer to 7 -> Color 7.\n    *   **Component B** (Right/Bottom): Includes the large loop and the bottom line.

These seeds effectively become part of the wall structure.\n    *   **Space Fillers**: Seeds that are not adjacent to any wall cell, or Wall Masters that are not Pure Walls.\n3.  **Color Walls**:\n    *   The input 1s (walls) are colored by the **Wall Master** seeds.\n    *   Each connected component of walls takes the color of the nearest Wall Master (using path distance through the walls).\n    *   If a component contains a **Pure Wall** seed, the entire component takes the color of that seed.\n4.  **Color Space**:\n    *   The input 0s (space) are filled by the **Space Filler** seeds (and non-Pure Wall Masters).\n    *   This is a multi-source flood fill (Voronoi tessellation) using Manhattan distance.\n    *   The walls (now colored) act as barriers.\n    *   **Pure Wall** seeds do *not* fill space; they only color the walls.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds**:\n    *   5 at (0,1): Space Filler.\n    *   3 at (0,3): Wall Master (adjacent to (1,3)).
