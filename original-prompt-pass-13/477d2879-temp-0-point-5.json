              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Seeds and Regions**: The grid contains \"seed\" numbers (non-zero, non-one digits) and \"walls\" (digit 1). The 0s represent empty space. Each seed expands to fill the connected 0s around it, forming a region.\n2.  **Barriers**: The expansion is blocked by walls (1s) and other seeds.\n3.  **Hierarchy and Wall Coloring**:\n    *   The walls (1s) themselves are colored based on the region they enclose or separate.\n    *   **Enclosure Rule**: If a region (Inner) is enclosed by walls that separate it from another region (Outer), the walls take the color of the **Outer** region.\n        *   Example: Region 8 inside Region 2 -> Wall becomes 2. Region 2 inside Region 3 -> Wall becomes 3.\n    *   **Peer Rule**: If two regions are adjacent (siblings) and neither strictly encloses the other (e.g., both touch the grid boundary), the wall takes the color of the region that is \"more outer\" or simply the majority neighbor.\n    *   **Outer Definition**: Regions connected to the grid boundary (especially the background) are \"Outer\". Regions fully surrounded by walls are \"Inner\".\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds**: 5 (Top Left), 3 (Top Right), 7 (Middle Left), 8 (Middle Center), 6 (Middle Right), 4 (Bottom).\n*   **Region Filling**:\n    *   **4**: Fills the entire bottom area (Rows 10-12) and wraps around the bottom-right corner gap to potentially connect to the right edge.\n    *   **5**: Fills the top-left corner (0,0)-(2,2).\n    *   **3**: Fills the top-right area.\n    *   **7**: Fills the middle-left \"pocket\" enclosed by walls.\n    *   **8**: Fills the small enclosed area in the center (Rows 4-6, Cols 8-10).\n    *   **6**: Fills the area to the right of 8 and below it (Rows 7-8), connecting to the right edge.\n*   **Wall Coloring**:\n    *   **Row 9 Wall**: Separates the upper regions (7, 6) from the bottom region (4). Since 4 is the large bottom region touching the boundary, it is \"Outer\" to the enclosed/semi-enclosed 7 and 6. **Wall becomes 4.**\n    *   **Col 7 Wall**: Separates 7 (Left) and 8 (Right). 7 touches the left border (Outer). 8 is enclosed (Inner). **Wall becomes 7.**\n    *   **Row 3 Wall**: Separates 5/3 (Top) and 7 (Bottom). 5/3 touch the top border (Outer). 7 is enclosed (Inner). **Wall becomes 5 (left part) and 3 (right part).**\n    *   **Col 11 Wall**: Separates 8 (Left) and 6 (Right). 6 touches the right border (Outer). 8 is enclosed (Inner). **Wall becomes 6.**\n    *   **Row 1/2 Walls**: Separate 5 and 3.

The 0s represent empty space. Each seed expands to fill the connected 0s around it, forming a region.\n2.  **Barriers**: The expansion is blocked by walls (1s) and other seeds.\n3.  **Hierarchy and Wall Coloring**:\n    *   The walls (1s) themselves are colored based on the region they enclose or separate.\n    *   **Enclosure Rule**: If a region (Inner) is enclosed by walls that separate it from another region (Outer), the walls take the color of the **Outer** region.\n        *   Example: Region 8 inside Region 2 -> Wall becomes 2. Region 2 inside Region 3 -> Wall becomes 3.\n    *   **Peer Rule**: If two regions are adjacent (siblings) and neither strictly encloses the other (e.g., both touch the grid boundary), the wall takes the color of the region that is \"more outer\" or simply the majority neighbor.\n    *   **Outer Definition**: Regions connected to the grid boundary (especially the background) are \"Outer\".

The goal is to transform the grid by filling the walls and the regions they define with colors derived from the seeds.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Wall Identification:** The 1s in the grid form the skeleton of the walls.\n2.  **Seed Classification:**\n    *   **Wall Seeds:** Non-zero numbers that are adjacent (4-connected) to at least two 1s (or are part of a chain of 1s). These seeds determine the color of the wall they are embedded in.\n    *   **Region Seeds:** Non-zero numbers that are inside a region bounded by walls (or outside them). These seeds determine the color of the empty space (0s) within that region.\n3.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Walls:** All 1s belonging to a connected wall component are replaced by the color of the Wall Seed associated with that component.\n    *   **Regions:** All 0s belonging to a connected region (bounded by the colored walls) are replaced by the color of the Region Seed contained within that region.\n    *   **Seeds:** The seeds themselves remain their original color (which matches the region or wall they colored).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Seeds:**\n    *   **5** at (0,1): Region Seed (no adjacent 1s).\n    *   **3** at (0,3): Region Seed (adjacent to only one 1 at (1,3), acts as a blocker/corner).

              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation rule is:\n1.  **Identify Seeds:** Non-zero numbers in the input grid (excluding 1s) act as seeds for regions.\n2.  **Identify Walls:** Cells with value 1 in the input grid act as walls or boundaries.\n3.  **Flood Fill:** Each seed expands to fill the connected 0s (empty cells) to form a region. The expansion is blocked by walls (1s) and other seeds/regions.\n    *   Expansion generally follows a Voronoi-like pattern or shortest path in the grid graph (Manhattan distance).\n    *   Some seeds (like 3 in Example 0) appear to act as \"Background\" filling open spaces, while others (like 2 and 8) act as \"Objects\" filling enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces.\n4.  **Color Walls:** After the regions are defined, the wall cells (1s) are colored.\n    *   A wall cell typically takes the color of the adjacent region that is considered an \"Object\" or \"Enclosed\" region (as opposed to \"Background\").\n    *   If a wall separates two object regions, it may be split or take the color of the dominant/closer seed.\n    *   If a wall is surrounded by a single region, it becomes part of that region.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds:** 5 (0,1), 3 (0,3), 7 (4,2), 8 (5,9), 6 (7,11), 4 (11,3).\n*   **Regions:**\n    *   **Region 5:** Enclosed in the top-left corner by walls at (1,3), (2,2), (3,0)-(3,2). Fills (0,0)-(0,2), (1,0)-(1,2), (2,0)-(2,1).\n    *   **Region 3:** Starts at (0,3). Fills the open space in the top section not claimed by others. Fills (0,4)-(0,12), (1,4)-(1,5), (2,4)-(2,5), (3,3)-(3,5), (4,3)-(4,6), (5,3)-(5,6).\n    *   **Region 7:** Starts at (4,2). Fills the area below the (3,0)-(3,2) wall and left of the (7,5) wall structure. Fills (4,1), (5,1)-(5,2), (6,0)-(6,6), (7,0)-(7,4), (8,0)-(8,4).\n    *   **Region 8:** Enclosed \"room\" in the mid-right. Fills (3,8)-(3,9), (4,8)-(4,10), (5,8)-(5,10), (6,8)-(6,10).\n    *   **Region 6:** Enclosed area in the bottom-right of the top section.

The expansion is blocked by walls (1s) and other seeds/regions.\n    *   Expansion generally follows a Voronoi-like pattern or shortest path in the grid graph (Manhattan distance).\n    *   Some seeds (like 3 in Example 0) appear to act as \"Background\" filling open spaces, while others (like 2 and 8) act as \"Objects\" filling enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces.\n4.  **Color Walls:** After the regions are defined, the wall cells (1s) are colored.\n    *   A wall cell typically takes the color of the adjacent region that is considered an \"Object\" or \"Enclosed\" region (as opposed to \"Background\").\n    *   If a wall separates two object regions, it may be split or take the color of the dominant/closer seed.\n    *   If a wall is surrounded by a single region, it becomes part of that region.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds:** 5 (0,1), 3 (0,3), 7 (4,2), 8 (5,9), 6 (7,11), 4 (11,3).\n*   **Regions:**\n    *   **Region 5:** Enclosed in the top-left corner by walls at (1,3), (2,2), (3,0)-(3,2). Fills (0,0)-(0,2), (1,0)-(1,2), (2,0)-(2,1).\n    *   **Region 3:** Starts at (0,3). Fills the open space in the top section not claimed by others. Fills (0,4)-(0,12), (1,4)-(1,5), (2,4)-(2,5), (3,3)-(3,5), (4,3)-(4,6), (5,3)-(5,6).\n    *   **Region 7:** Starts at (4,2). Fills the area below the (3,0)-(3,2) wall and left of the (7,5) wall structure. Fills (4,1), (5,1)-(5,2), (6,0)-(6,6), (7,0)-(7,4), (8,0)-(8,4).\n    *   **Region 8:** Enclosed \"room\" in the mid-right.
