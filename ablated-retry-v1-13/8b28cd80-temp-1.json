The position of this digit varies.\n3.  **Symmetry and Transformation:**\n    *   Comparing **Example 1** (Input non-zero at `(1, 0)`) and **Example 2** (Input non-zero at `(0, 1)`), we observe that their positions are transposes of each other (swapping row and column indices).\n    *   Looking closely at their outputs, the output of Example 2 is exactly the **transpose** of the output of Example 1 (with the color changed to match the input).\n    *   Example: In Ex 1, Row 0 is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5]`.

The test input (Bottom-Left) corresponds to the 180-degree rotation of Example 4 (Top-Right). \n\nInput: 3 at (2, 0).\nThis is the 180-degree rotation of Example 4's input (7 at (0, 2)).\nTherefore, the output should be the 180-degree rotation of Example 4's output, with the color changed from 7 to 3.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n1. Take Example 4 output grid.\n2. Rotate it 180 degrees (which is equivalent to reversing the order of rows, and then reversing the order of elements in each row).\n3.
