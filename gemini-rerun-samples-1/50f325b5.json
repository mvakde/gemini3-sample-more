There is a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output. Now the test input differs slightly from the train input. Ideally a generalised transformation should have been applied to the test input to generate the test output. But the puzzle solver got confused and made a mistake.

        "raw_text": "The goal is to identify the pattern from the training examples and apply it to the test example, correcting the mistake in the provided \"Wrong Output\".\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify the Target Shape:** In each training example, there is a specific shape formed by the digit `8` in the input grid.\n    *   Example 0: A \"T\" shape.\n    *   Example 1: A specific 4-cell shape.\n    *   Example 2: A \"T\" shape (rotated).\n    *   Example 3: A \"+\" shape.\n2.  **Find Matching Components:** The transformation involves finding connected components of another color (specifically `3` in all examples) that contain the same shape as the `8`s (allowing for rotation).\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   In Example 2, we observed that if a connected component of `3`s *contains* the target shape, the *entire* component is changed to `8`s, even if it has extra cells attached (e.g., a size 5 component containing a size 4 shape).\n    *   The mistake in the \"Wrong Output\" for the test example is that the solver only colored the cells that strictly formed the shape, leaving attached `3`s unchanged (partial coloring), and it also missed one component entirely.\n\n**Applying to Test Example:**\n1.  **Target Shape (from Input `8`s):**\n    *   Located at (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3).\n    *   Shape: A vertical \"Z\" or \"step\" shape (size 4).\n    *   Visual:\n        ```\n        8 .\n        8 8\n        . 8\n        ```\n\n2.  **Identify Components of `3`s containing the shape:**\n    *   **Component 1 (Right side):** Located around (10,13).\n        *   Cells: (9,13), (10,13), (10,14), (11,13), (11,14).\n        *   Contains the vertical Z shape: (9,13), (10,13), (10,14), (11,14).\n        *   Action: Change ALL cells in this component to `8`.\n    *   **Component 2 (Bottom Right):** Located around (14,15).\n        *   Cells: (13,15), (14,13), (14,14), (14,15), (14,16), (15,16).\n        *   Contains the vertical Z shape: (13,15), (14,15), (14,16), (15,16).\n        *   Action: Change ALL cells in this component to `8`.\n    *   **Component 3 (Bottom Left):** Located around (13,2).\n        *   Cells: (13,0), (13,1), (13,2), (13,3), (14,3), (14,4), (14,5).\n        *   Contains the horizontal Z shape (rotated 90 degrees): (13,2), (13,3), (14,3), (14,4).\n        *   Action: Change ALL cells in this component to `8`.\n\n3.  **Correction:**\n    *   The \"Wrong Output\" missed Component 3 entirely.\n    *   The \"Wrong Output\" only partially colored Components 1 and 2 (leaving (11,13), (14,13), (14,14) as `3`s).\n    *   The Correct Output must have all cells of these three components changed to `8`.\n\n**Correct Output Generation:**\n\n```json\n[\n [7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7],\n [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2],\n [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2],\n [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0],\n [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4],\n [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0],\n [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0],\n [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 8, 0, 7, 3],\n [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7, 2],\n [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 3],\n [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 8]\n]\n```",
