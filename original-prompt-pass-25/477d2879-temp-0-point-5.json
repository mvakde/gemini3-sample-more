              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the pattern is a region-filling transformation (similar to a Voronoi diagram or watershed algorithm) where:\n1.  **Seeds**: The non-zero, non-one numbers in the input act as seeds for regions.\n2.  **Regions**: The 0s (empty space) are filled with the value of the nearest seed. Connectivity matters; walls (1s) block direct paths, but regions can flow around them.\n3.  **Walls**: The 1s (walls) are also colored. They take the color of the region they enclose or bound. If a wall separates two regions, it typically takes the color of the more \"enclosed\" or \"inner\" region, or follows the split of the adjacent empty cells.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\n*   **Region 5**: Top-left corner. Bounded by walls at Row 3 and boundary with Region 3.\n*   **Region 3**: Top-middle/right. Bills the area to the right of Region 5 and above the wall at Row 1 (cols 6-10).\n*   **Region 7**: Middle-left \"room\". Enclosed by walls at Row 3 (top), Row 7 (bottom), and Col 6/7 (right).\n*   **Region 8**: Middle-right \"room\". Enclosed by walls at Row 1 (top), Row 9 (bottom), Col 7 (left), and Col 11 (right).\n*   **Region 6**: Top-right gap and rightmost strip (Col 12). It flows down the right side.\n*   **Region 4**: Bottom area (Rows 10-12). Separated from the top by the wall at Row 9.\n\n**Detailed Row-by-Row Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0**: 5s on the left, 3s on the right. Split at (0,2).\n*   **Row 1**: 5s on left. Wall at (1,3) becomes 3. Wall at (1,6)-(1,10) encloses Region 8, so it becomes 8. Rest is 3.\n*   **Row 2**: Region 7 starts on left. Region 8 on right. Wall at (2,6) becomes 8. Wall at (2,10) becomes 8. Far right is 3.\n*   **Row 3**: Walls at (3,0)-(3,2) become 7. Walls at (3,6)-(3,7) split between 7 and 8. Walls at (3,10)-(3,11) become 8. Far right transitions to 6? Let's keep it 3/6 split around row 4.\n*   **Row 4-8**: Region 7 fills left (0-6). Region 8 fills middle (8-10). Walls at Col 7/11 become 7/8/6 respectively.\n*   **Row 9**: The long wall. Separates 7/8 (top) from 4/6 (bottom). Since 7/8 are enclosed rooms, the wall takes their colors. Left part 7, right part 8.\n*   **Row 10-12**: Region 4 fills the bottom left. Region 6 fills the bottom right. The boundary is around Col 7, defined by the walls at Row 11 (7,8) which belong to the 6 region (blocking 4).\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]"

        "raw_text": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the pattern is a region-filling transformation (similar to a Voronoi diagram or watershed algorithm) where:\n1.  **Seeds**: The non-zero, non-one numbers in the input act as seeds for regions.\n2.  **Regions**: The 0s (empty space) are filled with the value of the nearest seed. Connectivity matters; walls (1s) block direct paths, but regions can flow around them.\n3.  **Walls**: The 1s (walls) are also colored. They take the color of the region they enclose or bound. If a wall separates two regions, it typically takes the color of the more \"enclosed\" or \"inner\" region, or follows the split of the adjacent empty cells.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\n*   **Region 5**: Top-left corner. Bounded by walls at Row 3 and boundary with Region 3.\n*   **Region 3**: Top-middle/right. Bills the area to the right of Region 5 and above the wall at Row 1 (cols 6-10).\n*   **Region 7**: Middle-left \"room\". Enclosed by walls at Row 3 (top), Row 7 (bottom), and Col 6/7 (right).\n*   **Region 8**: Middle-right \"room\". Enclosed by walls at Row 1 (top), Row 9 (bottom), Col 7 (left), and Col 11 (right).\n*   **Region 6**: Top-right gap and rightmost strip (Col 12). It flows down the right side.\n*   **Region 4**: Bottom area (Rows 10-12). Separated from the top by the wall at Row 9.\n\n**Detailed Row-by-Row Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0**: 5s on the left, 3s on the right. Split at (0,2).\n*   **Row 1**: 5s on left. Wall at (1,3) becomes 3. Wall at (1,6)-(1,10) encloses Region 8, so it becomes 8. Rest is 3.\n*   **Row 2**: Region 7 starts on left. Region 8 on right. Wall at (2,6) becomes 8. Wall at (2,10) becomes 8. Far right is 3.\n*   **Row 3**: Walls at (3,0)-(3,2) become 7. Walls at (3,6)-(3,7) split between 7 and 8. Walls at (3,10)-(3,11) become 8. Far right transitions to 6? Let's keep it 3/6 split around row 4.\n*   **Row 4-8**: Region 7 fills left (0-6). Region 8 fills middle (8-10). Walls at Col 7/11 become 7/8/6 respectively.\n*   **Row 9**: The long wall. Separates 7/8 (top) from 4/6 (bottom). Since 7/8 are enclosed rooms, the wall takes their colors. Left part 7, right part 8.\n*   **Row 10-12**: Region 4 fills the bottom left. Region 6 fills the bottom right. The boundary is around Col 7, defined by the walls at Row 11 (7,8) which belong to the 6 region (blocking 4).\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]",

              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Walls\":** The input grid contains cells with the value `1`. These form connected structures that define boundaries.\n2.  **Identify \"Seeds\":** Non-zero, non-one numbers in the input grid are seeds that propagate their color.\n3.  **Classify Wall Components:**\n    *   Group the `1`s into connected components (using 4-connectivity).\n    *   If a Wall Component contains a seed (i.e., a seed is \"embedded\" in the wall structure, meaning it has at least two `1`-neighbors or completes a line), that entire Wall Component takes the color of the embedded seed and becomes an **Active Source**.\n    *   If a Wall Component does not contain a seed, it takes the color of the adjacent seed(s). If adjacent to multiple seeds, it seems to split or take the color based on proximity/strength. These walls are **Inactive** and act as barriers but do not propagate color themselves (or propagate it weakly).\n4.  **Flood Fill / Voronoi Tessellation:**\n    *   The remaining `0` cells are filled based on their Manhattan distance to the nearest Source.\n    *   **Sources** are the isolated Seeds and the Active Walls.\n    *   **Inactive Walls** block the path of the fill (distance is calculated around them, or they simply define the region boundaries).\n    *   **Tie-Breaking:** If a cell is equidistant from a Wall Source and a Seed Source, the Wall Source's color seems to win (based on Example 0). If equidistant between two Seeds, it follows standard Voronoi logic (often creating a straight boundary).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds:** 5 at (0,1), 3 at (0,3), 7 at (4,2), 8 at (5,9), 6 at (7,11), 4 at (11,3).\n*   **Walls:**\n    *   **Component A (Main Structure):** A large connected structure involving row 9, the right side (cols 6-11), and parts of the middle. It contains Seed 6 at (7,11) which is embedded (neighbors are 1s). **Action:** This entire component becomes color **6** and acts as an Active Source.\n    *   **Component B (Top Left):** A smaller structure at (1,3), (2,2)-(2,3), (3,0)-(3,2). It touches Seed 3 at (0,3) and Seed 7 at (4,2) but contains neither. **Action:** It is an Inactive Wall. The parts closer to 3 become **3**, and parts closer to 7 become **7**.\n        *   (1,3), (2,3), (2,4) area -> 3.\n        *   (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) -> 7.\n\n*   **Filling Regions:**\n    *   **Top Left (Seed 5):** Fills (0,0)-(2,1). (0,2) is a tie between 5 and 3, assigned 5 based on proximity/neighbors.\n    *   **Top Middle (Seed 3):** Fills (0,3)-(2,4) area, bounded by Wall B (3) and Wall A (6).\n    *   **Middle Left (Seed 7):** Fills the area left of Wall A (col 7) and below Wall B. Fills rows 4-8, cols 0-4. Boundary with Wall A (6) creates a split where cells adjacent to the wall become 6.\n    *   **Inside U-Shape (Seed 8):** Seed 8 is at (5,9). It is surrounded by Wall A (6). Cells adjacent to the wall become 6. Only the immediate neighbors of 8 (and 8 itself) remain 8.\n    *   **Bottom (Seed 4):** Seed 4 is at (11,3). It is below Wall A (row 9). It fills a small region (11,2-4), (12,2-4). Cells adjacent to Wall A (row 9) become 6.\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation:**\n\n```json\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [5, 5, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]\n```"

        "raw_text": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Walls\":** The input grid contains cells with the value `1`. These form connected structures that define boundaries.\n2.  **Identify \"Seeds\":** Non-zero, non-one numbers in the input grid are seeds that propagate their color.\n3.  **Classify Wall Components:**\n    *   Group the `1`s into connected components (using 4-connectivity).\n    *   If a Wall Component contains a seed (i.e., a seed is \"embedded\" in the wall structure, meaning it has at least two `1`-neighbors or completes a line), that entire Wall Component takes the color of the embedded seed and becomes an **Active Source**.\n    *   If a Wall Component does not contain a seed, it takes the color of the adjacent seed(s). If adjacent to multiple seeds, it seems to split or take the color based on proximity/strength. These walls are **Inactive** and act as barriers but do not propagate color themselves (or propagate it weakly).\n4.  **Flood Fill / Voronoi Tessellation:**\n    *   The remaining `0` cells are filled based on their Manhattan distance to the nearest Source.\n    *   **Sources** are the isolated Seeds and the Active Walls.\n    *   **Inactive Walls** block the path of the fill (distance is calculated around them, or they simply define the region boundaries).\n    *   **Tie-Breaking:** If a cell is equidistant from a Wall Source and a Seed Source, the Wall Source's color seems to win (based on Example 0). If equidistant between two Seeds, it follows standard Voronoi logic (often creating a straight boundary).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds:** 5 at (0,1), 3 at (0,3), 7 at (4,2), 8 at (5,9), 6 at (7,11), 4 at (11,3).\n*   **Walls:**\n    *   **Component A (Main Structure):** A large connected structure involving row 9, the right side (cols 6-11), and parts of the middle. It contains Seed 6 at (7,11) which is embedded (neighbors are 1s). **Action:** This entire component becomes color **6** and acts as an Active Source.\n    *   **Component B (Top Left):** A smaller structure at (1,3), (2,2)-(2,3), (3,0)-(3,2). It touches Seed 3 at (0,3) and Seed 7 at (4,2) but contains neither. **Action:** It is an Inactive Wall. The parts closer to 3 become **3**, and parts closer to 7 become **7**.\n        *   (1,3), (2,3), (2,4) area -> 3.\n        *   (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) -> 7.\n\n*   **Filling Regions:**\n    *   **Top Left (Seed 5):** Fills (0,0)-(2,1). (0,2) is a tie between 5 and 3, assigned 5 based on proximity/neighbors.\n    *   **Top Middle (Seed 3):** Fills (0,3)-(2,4) area, bounded by Wall B (3) and Wall A (6).\n    *   **Middle Left (Seed 7):** Fills the area left of Wall A (col 7) and below Wall B. Fills rows 4-8, cols 0-4. Boundary with Wall A (6) creates a split where cells adjacent to the wall become 6.\n    *   **Inside U-Shape (Seed 8):** Seed 8 is at (5,9). It is surrounded by Wall A (6). Cells adjacent to the wall become 6. Only the immediate neighbors of 8 (and 8 itself) remain 8.\n    *   **Bottom (Seed 4):** Seed 4 is at (11,3). It is below Wall A (row 9). It fills a small region (11,2-4), (12,2-4). Cells adjacent to Wall A (row 9) become 6.\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation:**\n\n```json\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [5, 5, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]\n```",
