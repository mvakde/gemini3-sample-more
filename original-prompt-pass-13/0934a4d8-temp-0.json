              "content": "The pattern identified from the training examples is as follows:\n1.  **Locate the Block of 8s:** Find the rectangular region in the input grid that consists of the number 8. Let's denote the rows containing 8s as $r_{start}$ to $r_{end}$ and the columns as $c_{start}$ to $c_{end}$.\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as this block of 8s.\n3.  **Map Rows:** For each row $i$ in the output grid (corresponding to the 8s block row $r = r_{start} + i$), the content is derived from the input grid at row $R = 31 - r$.\n4.  **Map Columns:** The columns extracted from the target row $R$ are the same columns where the 8s were found ($c_{start}$ to $c_{end}$).\n5.  **Handle Blocked Rows:** If the target row $R$ itself contains 8s in the target columns (which happens when the 8s block is symmetric around the center of the grid or overlaps with its reflection), the values cannot be extracted directly. In such cases (as seen in the Test Input), the values for the \"blocked\" rows are filled by mirroring the values from the \"clear\" rows. Specifically, the output grid becomes vertically palindromic.
