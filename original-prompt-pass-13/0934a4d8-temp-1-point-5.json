              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the problem asks to replace the rectangular region of 8s (representing \"holes\") in the grid with values derived from the symmetric properties of the grid.\n\n1.  **Identify the Hole:** In the test input, the number 8 appears in rows 14 through 22, and columns 0 through 2. This forms a $9 \\times 3$ rectangular hole.\n\n2.  **Determine Symmetry:**\n    *   **Vertical Symmetry:** In many examples, rows $r$ and $31-r$ are identical. Checking the valid rows (e.g., row 18 and row 13) confirms they are mirrors in the test input. However, rows 14-17 map to rows 17-14, which are also holes (a \"collision\"). Thus, we cannot use vertical symmetry for rows 14-17.\n    *   **Horizontal Symmetry:** In some examples, columns $c$ and $31-c$ mirror. Here, columns 0-2 would map to 31-29. Indices 30 and 31 are out of bounds for a $30 \\times 30$ grid.\n    *   **Transpose Symmetry (Main Diagonal):** Checking the test input grid reveals it is symmetric across the main diagonal ($A[i][j] = A[j][i]$). For example, `Grid[18][0]` is an 8 (hole), but `Grid[0][18]` is 4, which matches the value derived from vertical symmetry for row 18.

This forms a $9 \\times 3$ rectangular hole.\n\n2.  **Determine Symmetry:**\n    *   **Vertical Symmetry:** In many examples, rows $r$ and $31-r$ are identical. Checking the valid rows (e.g., row 18 and row 13) confirms they are mirrors in the test input. However, rows 14-17 map to rows 17-14, which are also holes (a \"collision\"). Thus, we cannot use vertical symmetry for rows 14-17.\n    *   **Horizontal Symmetry:** In some examples, columns $c$ and $31-c$ mirror. Here, columns 0-2 would map to 31-29. Indices 30 and 31 are out of bounds for a $30 \\times 30$ grid.\n    *   **Transpose Symmetry (Main Diagonal):** Checking the test input grid reveals it is symmetric across the main diagonal ($A[i][j] = A[j][i]$).
