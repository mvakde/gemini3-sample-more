There is a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output. Now the test input differs slightly from the train input. Ideally a generalised transformation should have been applied to the test input to generate the test output. But the puzzle solver got confused and made a mistake. Figure out the mistake and generate the correct test output by correcting the mistake and applying the generalised transformation.\n\nRespond in the format of the output grids\n\n--Training

The output is a smaller grid corresponding to the content that *should* be in the masked region.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The grid exhibits a vertical reflection symmetry. Specifically, the row at index `i` is identical to the row at index `32 - i` (using 0-based indexing, but effectively mapping row `i` to row `N-i` with an offset).\n    *   In Example 0, the mask is at rows 7-10. The output corresponds to rows 24-21 (which are `31-7`, `31-8`, etc.).\n    *   In Example 1, the mask is at rows 2-5. The output corresponds to rows 29-26.\n    *   In Example 2, the mask is at rows 14-22. The symmetry axis is row 16. Rows 19-22 are recovered from rows 13-9.
