If a cell and all four of its neighbors are 0, then all 5 of those cells are changed to 3 (green) in the output. 8s (teal) act as walls and are never overwritten.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the Test Input.\n\n**1. Identify Valid Centers (cells where Input[r][c] == 0 and all 4 neighbors == 0):**\n\n*   **Top Area:**\n    *   Checking around row 2, column 5:\n        *   Center (2, 5) is 0.\n        *   Neighbors: (1, 5)=0, (3, 5)=0, (2, 4)=0, (2, 6)=0.\n        *   All are 0. **(2, 5) is a valid center.**\n\n*   **Bottom Left Area:**\n    *   Checking around row 9, column 1:\n        *   Center (9, 1) is 0.\n        *   Neighbors: (8, 1)=0, (10, 1)=0, (9, 0)=0, (9, 2)=0.\n        *   All are 0. **(9, 1) is a valid center.**\n    *   Checking around row 9, column 2:\n        *   Center (9, 2) is 0.\n        *   Neighbors: (8, 2)=0, (10, 2)=0, (9, 1)=0, (9, 3)=0.\n        *   All are 0. **(9, 2) is a valid center.**\n\n    *   *Note on other potential centers:*\n        *   (8, 2): Right neighbor (8, 3) is 8. Invalid.\n        *   (10, 1): Down neighbor (11, 1) is 8. Invalid.\n        *   (10, 2): Down neighbor (11, 2) is 8. Invalid.\n\n**2. Apply Transformation (Change valid plus shapes to 3):**\n\n*   **From Center (2, 5):**\n    *   Cells (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5) become 3.\n\n*   **From Center (9, 1):**\n    *   Cells (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (10, 1) become 3.\n\n*   **From Center (9, 2):**\n    *   Cells (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2) become 3.\n\n**3. Construct Final Grid:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** (1, 5) becomes 3.\n*   **Row 2:** (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6) become 3.\n*   **Row 3:** (3, 5) becomes 3.\n*   **Row 8:** (8, 1), (8, 2) become 3.\n*   **Row 9:** (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3) become 3.\n*   **Row 10:** (10, 1), (10, 2) become 3.\n\nThe \"Wrong Output\" provided in the problem statement contained several errors:\n1.  It placed a 3 at (1, 4) which is not part of a plus shape.\n2.  It placed a 3 at (7, 2) which is not part of a plus shape.\n3.  It failed to place a 3 at (9, 0).\n4.  It overwrote 8s with 3s at (10, 3), (11, 1), and (11, 2).\n5.  It incorrectly placed an 8 at (8, 1) where the input was 0 (and should have been 3).\n\nHere is the corrected output grid:\n\n```json\n[\n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n```"

        "raw_text": "Based on the training examples, the pattern is to identify every occurrence of a \"plus\" shape consisting of 5 zeros (a center cell and its four orthogonal neighbors: up, down, left, right) in the input grid. If a cell and all four of its neighbors are 0, then all 5 of those cells are changed to 3 (green) in the output. 8s (teal) act as walls and are never overwritten.\n\nLet's apply this transformation to the Test Input.\n\n**1. Identify Valid Centers (cells where Input[r][c] == 0 and all 4 neighbors == 0):**\n\n*   **Top Area:**\n    *   Checking around row 2, column 5:\n        *   Center (2, 5) is 0.\n        *   Neighbors: (1, 5)=0, (3, 5)=0, (2, 4)=0, (2, 6)=0.\n        *   All are 0. **(2, 5) is a valid center.**\n\n*   **Bottom Left Area:**\n    *   Checking around row 9, column 1:\n        *   Center (9, 1) is 0.\n        *   Neighbors: (8, 1)=0, (10, 1)=0, (9, 0)=0, (9, 2)=0.\n        *   All are 0. **(9, 1) is a valid center.**\n    *   Checking around row 9, column 2:\n        *   Center (9, 2) is 0.\n        *   Neighbors: (8, 2)=0, (10, 2)=0, (9, 1)=0, (9, 3)=0.\n        *   All are 0. **(9, 2) is a valid center.**\n\n    *   *Note on other potential centers:*\n        *   (8, 2): Right neighbor (8, 3) is 8. Invalid.\n        *   (10, 1): Down neighbor (11, 1) is 8. Invalid.\n        *   (10, 2): Down neighbor (11, 2) is 8. Invalid.\n\n**2. Apply Transformation (Change valid plus shapes to 3):**\n\n*   **From Center (2, 5):**\n    *   Cells (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5) become 3.\n\n*   **From Center (9, 1):**\n    *   Cells (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (10, 1) become 3.\n\n*   **From Center (9, 2):**\n    *   Cells (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2) become 3.\n\n**3. Construct Final Grid:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** (1, 5) becomes 3.\n*   **Row 2:** (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6) become 3.\n*   **Row 3:** (3, 5) becomes 3.\n*   **Row 8:** (8, 1), (8, 2) become 3.\n*   **Row 9:** (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3) become 3.\n*   **Row 10:** (10, 1), (10, 2) become 3.\n\nThe \"Wrong Output\" provided in the problem statement contained several errors:\n1.  It placed a 3 at (1, 4) which is not part of a plus shape.\n2.  It placed a 3 at (7, 2) which is not part of a plus shape.\n3.  It failed to place a 3 at (9, 0).\n4.  It overwrote 8s with 3s at (10, 3), (11, 1), and (11, 2).\n5.  It incorrectly placed an 8 at (8, 1) where the input was 0 (and should have been 3).\n\nHere is the corrected output grid:\n\n```json\n[\n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n```",
