These seeds expand to fill the connected component of `1`s. They do not fill `0`s.\n    *   **Room Seeds**: Seeds that are in open space (surrounded mostly by `0`s). These seeds expand to fill the connected component of `0`s (empty space).\n3.  **Expansion**:\n    *   **Room Expansion**: Room Seeds flood-fill the accessible `0`s. `1`s act as barriers.\n    *   **Wall Expansion**: Wall Seeds flood-fill the accessible `1`s.\n4.  **Wall Capture**: Any `1`s that are not connected to a Wall Seed (and thus not filled by Wall Expansion) are \"captured\" by the adjacent Room regions. A wall cell takes the value of the Room region it touches.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds**:\n    *   `5` at (0,1): Room Seed. Fills top-left `0`s.\n    *   `3` at (0,3): Room Seed. Fills top-right `0`s and wraps around the right side.\n    *   `7` at (4,2): Room Seed. Fills the large middle-left `0` region.\n    *   `8` at (5,9): Room Seed. Fills the enclosed \"island\" of `0`s in the center-right.\n    *   `6` at (7,11): Wall Seed (Neighbors (6,11) and (8,11) are `1`s). Fills the connected wall network.\n    *   `4` at (11,3): Room Seed. Fills the bottom `0` region.\n\n*   **Wall Structure**:\n    *   The `1`s around the `8` seed and the bottom line (Row 9) form a connected component touching the Wall Seed `6`. Thus, this entire wall structure becomes `6`.\n    *   The `1`s in the top-left (Row 1-3, Col 0-3 area) are isolated from the `6` network. They are captured by neighbors `5`, `3`, and `7`.\n\n*   **Region Filling**:\n    *   **Region 5**: Fills (0,0)-(0,2), (1,0)-(1,2), (2,0)-(2,1).

These seeds expand to fill the connected component of `1`s. They do not fill `0`s.\n    *   **Room Seeds**: Seeds that are in open space (surrounded mostly by `0`s). These seeds expand to fill the connected component of `0`s (empty space).\n3.  **Expansion**:\n    *   **Room Expansion**: Room Seeds flood-fill the accessible `0`s. `1`s act as barriers.\n    *   **Wall Expansion**: Wall Seeds flood-fill the accessible `1`s.\n4.  **Wall Capture**: Any `1`s that are not connected to a Wall Seed (and thus not filled by Wall Expansion) are \"captured\" by the adjacent Room regions. A wall cell takes the value of the Room region it touches.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds**:\n    *   `5` at (0,1): Room Seed. Fills top-left `0`s.\n    *   `3` at (0,3): Room Seed. Fills top-right `0`s and wraps around the right side.\n    *   `7` at (4,2): Room Seed. Fills the large middle-left `0` region.\n    *   `8` at (5,9): Room Seed. Fills the enclosed \"island\" of `0`s in the center-right.\n    *   `6` at (7,11): Wall Seed (Neighbors (6,11) and (8,11) are `1`s). Fills the connected wall network.\n    *   `4` at (11,3): Room Seed. Fills the bottom `0` region.\n\n*   **Wall Structure**:\n    *   The `1`s around the `8` seed and the bottom line (Row 9) form a connected component touching the Wall Seed `6`. Thus, this entire wall structure becomes `6`.\n    *   The `1`s in the top-left (Row 1-3, Col 0-3 area) are isolated from the `6` network. They are captured by neighbors `5`, `3`, and `7`.\n\n*   **Region Filling**:\n    *   **Region 5**: Fills (0,0)-(0,2), (1,0)-(1,2), (2,0)-(2,1). Captures wall (2,2).\n    *   **Region 3**: Fills (0,4)-(0,12), down the right side (Col 12), and the channel (1,4)-(1,5), (2,4)-(2,5). Captures walls (1,3), (2,3).\n    *   **Region 7**: Fills (3,3)-(3,5), (4,0)-(4,6), down to row 8. Captures walls (3,0)-(3,2).\n    *   **Region 8**: Fills the inside of the 6-wall loop: (2,7)-(2,9) to (8,6)-(8,10).\n    *   **Region 6**: Fills the walls enclosing Region 8 and the wall at Row 9.\n    *   **Region 4**: Fills everything below the Row 9 wall (Rows 10-12, Cols 0-11).\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation:**\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], \n [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3], \n [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3, 3], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3], \n [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]]",

Let's map walls enclosing 7 to 7.\n*   **Region 3 (Top Mid):** Fills `R0-4` `C3-5`.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6],\n [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\n(Refining Row 2 wall at (2,2)-(2,3): It touches 5, 7, and 3. The wall at (3,0-2) is clearly 7's roof. (2,2-3) is likely 5's floor or 7's roof extension. Given 7's strong enclosure, let's assign 7 or 5. Looking at neighbors in my generated grid: (2,2) is surrounded by 5s and 7s. (2,3) neighbors 5, 3, 7. I will assign 5 to row 2 walls to keep Region 5 coherent, and 7 to row 3 walls.)\n\n(Refining Row 1 wall at (1,3): Neighbors 5 and 3. Assigned 3.)\n(Refining Row 9 wall: Separates top and bottom. Bottom is 4. Assigned 4.)\n\nOne check on Region 8:\nInput R2: `0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0`. Index 6 is 1. Index 10 is 1. 7,8,9 are 0.\nRegion 8 is in cols 7,8,9.\nMy output has 8s in 6,7,8,9,10,11?\nWall at 6 becomes 8. Wall at 10 becomes 8.\nWall at 11? R2, C11 is 0 in input. So Region 6. Correct.\n\nFinal Output:\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 5, 5, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]",

Each seed originates a colored region.\n2.  **Expansion:** The seeds expand into the connected 0s (using 4-way connectivity) to form regions. This behaves like a Voronoi diagram constrained by the 1-walls. Each cell of 0 takes the color of the nearest seed (in terms of path length avoiding 1s).\n3.  **Wall Coloring:** The 1s, which act as boundaries during the expansion phase, are themselves colored in the final output. A 1-cell takes the color of the region it bounds. Specifically, it appears to adopt the color of the most prevalent or nearest neighboring region.\n4.  **Tie-Breaking:** In cases where regions meet without a wall (or 1s are equidistant), boundaries form based on distance.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\n**Seeds:**\n-   **5** at (0, 1)\n-   **3** at (0, 3)\n-   **7** at (4, 2)\n-   **8** at (5, 9)\n-   **6** at (7, 11)\n-   **4** at (11, 3)\n\n**Region Analysis:**\n-   **5 (Top-Left):** Fills the top-left corner. Bounded by walls at R1(3), R2(2), R3(0-2). It meets **3** around column 2.\n-   **3 (Top-Right):** Fills the large area to the right of 5 and above 7. It connects to the 7 region but is closer to the top rows. Expands rightwards to fill the empty space in the top right.\n-   **7 (Middle-Left):** Bounded above by walls at R3(0-2) and R2/R3 interface. Bounded below by a solid wall line at R9 (which runs across the grid). Expands into the middle section.\n-   **8 (Middle-Right, Top):** Located at (5,9). Bounded by walls at R1-R3(6,10/11) and R5-R8(7/11). It shares the right-side vertical corridor with 6.\n-   **6 (Middle-Right, Bottom):** Located at (7,11). Connects to 8's region. The boundary will be determined by distance (Voronoi) roughly between rows 6 and 7.\n-   **4 (Bottom):** Located at (11,3). Bounded above by the wall at R9.

Given 5 is \"inner\" to that corner, they might take 5 or 7. In training, walls often merged into the larger surrounding blocks or the distinct shape.

(Often the \"inner\" or \"bottom\" region color seems to dominate, or simply the one that surrounds it).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seeds Classification:**\n    *   **5** at (0,1): Region Seed (surrounded by 0s). Fills top-left region.\n    *   **3** at (0,3): Wall Seed (adjacent to 1 at (1,3)). Colors the wall segment.\n    *   **7** at (4,2): Wall Seed (adjacent to 1 at (3,2)). Colors the wall segment.\n    *   **8** at (5,9): Region Seed (surrounded by 0s). Fills the large central/top-right region.\n    *   **6** at (7,11): Region Seed. Fills the pocket on the right.\n    *   **4** at (11,3): Region Seed. Fills the bottom region (below row 9 wall).\n\n*   **Region Filling:**\n    *   **Region 5:** Top-left corner `(0,0)-(2,1)`.
