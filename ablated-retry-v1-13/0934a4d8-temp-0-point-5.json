This block represents a \"mask\" or a \"window\" where the true values are hidden. The goal is to reconstruct the values in this region.\n2.  **Vertical Symmetry:** The grid exhibits a vertical symmetry where row $i$ corresponds to row $31 - i$ (using 0-based indexing, and noting the effective symmetry axis).\n    *   For the rows in the bottom half of the '8' block (rows 18-22 in the test input), the values are retrieved from the symmetric rows in the top half (rows 13-9). Specifically, for a cell at $(r, c)$ containing an 8, the value is taken from grid[$31-r$][$c$].\n3.  **Handling Collisions:** For the rows in the center of the grid where the symmetric row also contains '8's (rows 14-17 in the test input), we cannot simply reflect to $31-r$.\n    *   Observation from examples and grid structure suggests these rows map to the *next* block of symmetric rows further out.\n    *   Rows 14-17 (Center Block) map to Rows 7-4 (Top Outer Block).\n    *   Specifically:\n        *   Row 14 maps to Row 7.\n        *   Row 15 maps to Row 6.\n        *   Row 16 maps to Row 6 (symmetric to 15).\n        *   Row 17 maps to Row 7 (symmetric to 14).\n    *   The columns remain the same as the columns of the '8's.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe '8's are located in columns 0, 1, 2 and rows 14 through 22.\n\n*   **Row 14:** Maps to Row 7.\n    *   Row 7 values at cols 0-2: `[4, 7, 7]`\n*   **Row 15:** Maps to Row 6.\n    *   Row 6 values at cols 0-2: `[7, 4, 9]`\n*   **Row 16:** Maps to Row 6.\n    *   Row 6 values at cols 0-2: `[7, 4, 9]`\n*   **Row 17:** Maps to Row 7.\n    *   Row 7 values at cols 0-2: `[4, 7, 7]`\n*   **Row 18:** Maps to Row 13 ($31-18$).\n    *   Row 13 values at cols 0-2: `[4, 4, 7]`\n*   **Row 19:** Maps to Row 12 ($31-19$).\n    *   Row 12 values at cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 1]`\n*   **Row 20:** Maps to Row 11 ($31-20$).\n    *   Row 11 values at cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 6]`\n*   **Row 21:** Maps to Row 10 ($31-21$).\n    *   Row 10 values at cols 0-2: `[1, 6, 1]`\n*   **Row 22:** Maps to Row 9 ($31-22$).\n    *   Row 9 values at cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 5]`\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n[[4, 7, 7], [7, 4, 9], [7, 4, 9], [4, 7, 7], [4, 4, 7], [6, 6, 1], [6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1], [6, 6, 5]]"

        "raw_text": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the pattern is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Region:** The input grid contains a rectangular block of '8's. This block represents a \"mask\" or a \"window\" where the true values are hidden. The goal is to reconstruct the values in this region.\n2.  **Vertical Symmetry:** The grid exhibits a vertical symmetry where row $i$ corresponds to row $31 - i$ (using 0-based indexing, and noting the effective symmetry axis).\n    *   For the rows in the bottom half of the '8' block (rows 18-22 in the test input), the values are retrieved from the symmetric rows in the top half (rows 13-9). Specifically, for a cell at $(r, c)$ containing an 8, the value is taken from grid[$31-r$][$c$].\n3.  **Handling Collisions:** For the rows in the center of the grid where the symmetric row also contains '8's (rows 14-17 in the test input), we cannot simply reflect to $31-r$.\n    *   Observation from examples and grid structure suggests these rows map to the *next* block of symmetric rows further out.\n    *   Rows 14-17 (Center Block) map to Rows 7-4 (Top Outer Block).\n    *   Specifically:\n        *   Row 14 maps to Row 7.\n        *   Row 15 maps to Row 6.\n        *   Row 16 maps to Row 6 (symmetric to 15).\n        *   Row 17 maps to Row 7 (symmetric to 14).\n    *   The columns remain the same as the columns of the '8's.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe '8's are located in columns 0, 1, 2 and rows 14 through 22.\n\n*   **Row 14:** Maps to Row 7.\n    *   Row 7 values at cols 0-2: `[4, 7, 7]`\n*   **Row 15:** Maps to Row 6.\n    *   Row 6 values at cols 0-2: `[7, 4, 9]`\n*   **Row 16:** Maps to Row 6.\n    *   Row 6 values at cols 0-2: `[7, 4, 9]`\n*   **Row 17:** Maps to Row 7.\n    *   Row 7 values at cols 0-2: `[4, 7, 7]`\n*   **Row 18:** Maps to Row 13 ($31-18$).\n    *   Row 13 values at cols 0-2: `[4, 4, 7]`\n*   **Row 19:** Maps to Row 12 ($31-19$).\n    *   Row 12 values at cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 1]`\n*   **Row 20:** Maps to Row 11 ($31-20$).\n    *   Row 11 values at cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 6]`\n*   **Row 21:** Maps to Row 10 ($31-21$).\n    *   Row 10 values at cols 0-2: `[1, 6, 1]`\n*   **Row 22:** Maps to Row 9 ($31-22$).\n    *   Row 9 values at cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 5]`\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n[[4, 7, 7], [7, 4, 9], [7, 4, 9], [4, 7, 7], [4, 4, 7], [6, 6, 1], [6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1], [6, 6, 5]]",
