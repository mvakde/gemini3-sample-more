There is a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output. Now the test input differs slightly from the train input. Ideally a generalised transformation should have been applied to the test input to generate the test output. But the puzzle solver got confused and made a mistake. Figure out the mistake and generate the correct test output by correcting the mistake and applying the generalised transformation.\n\nRespond in the format of the output grids\n\n--Training Examples--\n--Example 0-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n]\n\n--Example 1-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 0],\n [5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5]\n]\n\n--Example 2-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3],\n [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n]\n\n--Example 3-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 8],\n [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n\n--Example 4-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 7],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n]\n\n--End of Training Examples--\n\n--Test Example--\n\n INPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0],\n [3, 0, 0]\n]\n\nWRONG OUTPUT:\n\n[\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n]\n\n--End of Test Examples--\n\nYour response:"
