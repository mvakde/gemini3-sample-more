The shape of these `3`s (vertical line at col 8, horizontal line at row 5 starting at col 8) is a rotated version (-90 degrees) of the `8`s shape.\n    *   The transformation identifies connected components of `3`s that are congruent (via rotation/reflection) to the component of `8`s and changes them to `8`s.\n\n2.  **Example 1:**\n    *   The `8`s form a specific 4-cell shape.\n    *   Two clusters of `3`s change to `8`s. One matches the `8`s shape exactly. The other matches it after a geometric transformation (reflection/rotation).\n\n3.  **Example 2:**\n    *   The `8`s form a 'T' shape.\n    *   Two clusters of `3`s change. Both are 'right-pointing T' shapes (rotated -90 degrees).\n    *   Crucially, a cluster of 5 `3`s that *contains* the pattern only has the matching part changed; the extra cell remains `3`.\n\n**Rule:**\n1.  Identify the connected component of `8`s in the input grid and determine its shape.\n2.  Identify all connected components of `3`s in the grid.\n3.  Search for subgraphs of `3`s that are geometrically congruent (allowing for rotation and reflection) to the `8`s shape.\n4.  Change the value of the cells in these matching subgraphs from `3` to `8`.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify 8s Shape:**\n    *   Found at: `(4,2)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`.\n    *   Shape: A vertical 'Z' or zigzag shape.\n        *   Relative coordinates: `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`.\n        *   Path: Down, Right, Down.\n\n2.  **Search for matching 3s:**\n    *   We look for connected `3`s forming a Z/S shape (vertical or horizontal) anywhere in the grid.\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find a dense region of `3`s in rows 14 and 15.\n    *   At indices `(14,2)`, `(14,3)`, `(15,3)`, `(15,4)`, we observe the following values:\n        *   Row 14: `... 3, 3 ...` at indices 2, 3.\n        *   Row 15: `... 3, 3 ...` at indices 3, 4.\n    *   Shape formed:\n        *   `(14,2)` connected to `(14,3)` (Right).\n        *   `(14,3)` connected to `(15,3)` (Down).\n        *   `(15,3)` connected to `(15,4)` (Right).\n    *   This forms a horizontal 'Z' shape (path: Right, Down, Right).\n    *   This shape is congruent to the vertical 'Z' of the `8`s (which is Down, Right, Down) via a reflection across the main diagonal (transposing axes swaps Down and Right).\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Change `(14,2)`, `(14,3)`, `(15,3)`, `(15,4)` from `3` to `8`.\n    *   All other `3`s do not form this isolated 4-cell pattern (most are scattered or don't match the connectivity).\n\n**Final Output Construction:**\n*   Row 14: `[3, 3, 3, 3, ...]` becomes `[3, 3, 8, 8, ...]` (Indices 2 and 3 change).\n*   Row 15: `[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, ...]` becomes `[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, ...]` (Indices 3 and 4 change).\n\n```json\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]\n```"

Change the value of the cells in these matching subgraphs from `3` to `8`.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify 8s Shape:**\n    *   Found at: `(4,2)`, `(5,2)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,3)`.\n    *   Shape: A vertical 'Z' or zigzag shape.\n        *   Relative coordinates: `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`.\n        *   Path: Down, Right, Down.\n\n2.  **Search for matching 3s:**\n    *   We look for connected `3`s forming a Z/S shape (vertical or horizontal) anywhere in the grid.\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find a dense region of `3`s in rows 14 and 15.\n    *   At indices `(14,2)`, `(14,3)`, `(15,3)`, `(15,4)`, we observe the following values:\n        *   Row 14: `... 3, 3 ...` at indices 2, 3.\n        *   Row 15: `... 3, 3 ...` at indices 3, 4.\n    *   Shape formed:\n        *   `(14,2)` connected to `(14,3)` (Right).\n        *   `(14,3)` connected to `(15,3)` (Down).\n        *   `(15,3)` connected to `(15,4)` (Right).\n    *   This forms a horizontal 'Z' shape (path: Right, Down, Right).\n    *   This shape is congruent to the vertical 'Z' of the `8`s (which is Down, Right, Down) via a reflection across the main diagonal (transposing axes swaps Down and Right).\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Change `(14,2)`, `(14,3)`, `(15,3)`, `(15,4)` from `3` to `8`.\n    *   All other `3`s do not form this isolated 4-cell pattern (most are scattered or don't match the connectivity).\n\n**Final Output Construction:**\n*   Row 14: `[3, 3, 3, 3, ...]` becomes `[3, 3, 8, 8, ...]` (Indices 2 and 3 change).\n*   Row 15: `[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, ...]` becomes `[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, ...]` (Indices 3 and 4 change).\n\n```json\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]\n```",

The matching `3`s are then replaced with `8`s.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Shape (8s):**\n    *   Locate `8`s in the grid:\n        *   Row 4: `(4, 2)`\n        *   Row 5: `(5, 2), (5, 3)`\n        *   Row 6: `(6, 3)`\n    *   Relative to `(4, 2)`, the coordinates are `(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)`.\n    *   This forms a vertical \"S\" or \"step\" shape (width 2, height 3).\n\n2.  **Find Matches in 3s:**\n    *   We scan the grid for clusters of `3`s that form this shape or its rotations/reflections.\n    *   Looking at rows 13 and 14:\n        *   Row 13 has `3`s at indices `0, 1, 2, 3`.\n        *   Row 14 has `3`s at indices `3, 4, 5`.\n    *   Checking the subset of coordinates: `(13, 2), (13, 3)` and `(14, 3), (14, 4)`.\n        *   Row 13, Indices 2, 3 match.\n        *   Row 14, Indices 3, 4 match.\n    *   This configuration corresponds to:\n        *   Upper row pair at `(c, c+1)`\n        *   Lower row pair at `(c+1, c+2)`\n        *   Visual shape: `X X` on top, `X X` on bottom shifted right.\n        *   This matches the Horizontal S/Z shape (a rotated/mirrored version of the key).\n    *   No other valid 4-cell connected clusters of `3`s matching the key shape variants are found (others are disconnected or contain non-3 values).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Replace values at `(13, 2), (13, 3)` and `(14, 3), (14, 4)` with `8`.\n    *   All other values remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\n*   Row 13 changes: `[..., 3, 3, 3, 3, ...] -> [..., 3, 3, 8, 8, ...]` (Indices 2 and 3 change).\n*   Row 14 changes: `[..., 2, 3, 3, 3, ...] -> [..., 2, 8, 8, 3, ...]` (Indices 3 and 4 change).\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[[7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 7, 2, 7, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 3, 2, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [3, 2, 0, 3, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [4, 2, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 7, 2], [7, 0, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0], [3, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 0, 3, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 2, 3, 0], [2, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 0], [2, 7, 7, 4, 0, 3, 0, 2, 7, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3], [0, 0, 7, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 7, 4, 3, 2, 3, 0, 7, 3], [2, 7, 0, 3, 4, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 3], [4, 7, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7], [3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 4, 3]]",
