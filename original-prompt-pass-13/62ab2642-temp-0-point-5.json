We identify connected components of `0`s.\n2.  **Determine Openness:** For each connected region of `0`s, we check which edges of the grid it is \"open\" to (i.e., can reach the edge without crossing a `5`).\n3.  **Apply Color Rules:**\n    *   **Azure (`8`):** If a region is open to the **Right** edge of the grid, it is filled with `8`. This is seen in Example 0 (rows 6-11), Example 1 (right side), and Example 2 (bottom-right).\n    *   **Orange (`7`):** If a region is open to the **Top**, **Left**, or **Bottom** edges (but *not* the Right edge), it is filled with `7`.\n        *   Open to Top: Example 1 (top middle), Example 2 (top left).\n        *   Open to Left/Bottom: Example 0 (bottom left corner).\n    *   **Exceptions/Refinements:**\n        *   Regions that are fully enclosed by `5`s (no access to edges) would likely remain `0` (though none appear in the examples).\n        *   There is a specific case in Example 0 where a top-left region remains `0`, but in Examples 1 and 2, similar \"cup\" shapes are filled with `7`. Given the prevalence of filling in the other examples, we assume the rule is to fill \"cups\" or \"bays\".\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Component A (Top Center):** Pixels at `(0,2-6), (1,2-4), (2,3-4)`.

Open to **Top**. -> **Fill with `7`**.\n*   **Component D (Right Edge):** Pixels at `(0-4, 11)`. This strip connects to a small pocket at `(2,10)`.\n    *   Pocket at `(2,10)` is bounded by `5`s on Left, Top, and Bottom. Open to **Right**. -> **Fill with `8`**.\n    *   Since the strip `(0-4, 11)` is connected to this pocket and is open to the Right edge, the fill spreads. -> **Fill with `8`**.\n*   **Component E (Bottom Center):**\n    *   Left part `(2,6), (3,6), (4,4-6)`: Bounded by `5`s on Top, Left, Right.

This structure divides the background `0`s into different connected regions.\n2.  **Identify Pockets/Concavities**: We look for regions of `0`s that are partially enclosed by the `5`s.\n    *   **Top Pockets (Color 7)**: Regions of `0`s that are enclosed by `5`s on the Left, Right, and Bottom, but are **open to the Top edge** of the grid. In the examples, these are filled with `7` (Orange).\n    *   **Right Pockets (Color 8)**: Regions of `0`s that are enclosed by `5`s on the Left (and possibly Top/Bottom), but are **open to the Right edge** of the grid. In the examples, these are filled with `8` (Azure).\n    *   **Other Regions**: Regions open to the Left or Bottom (without being open to Top/Right in the specific colored configurations) generally remain `0`. Note that in Example 0, a small pocket open to the Bottom-Left was colored 7, but the dominant pattern in Examples 1 and 2 and the Test Input structure strongly suggests \"Open Top -> 7\" and \"Open Right -> 8\".\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Region B (Top Middle)**: The `0`s at `(0,2)-(0,6)`, `(1,2)-(1,4)`, and `(2,3)-(2,4)` form a region enclosed by `5`s on the Left, Right, and Bottom. They are open to the Top edge. This matches the pattern for **7**.\n*   **Region C (Top Right)**: The `0`s at `(0,8)-(0,9)` and `(1,8)` form a region enclosed by `5`s on the Left, Right, and Bottom. They are open to the Top edge. This matches the pattern for **7**.\n*   **Region D (Right Edge)**: The `0`s at `(0,11)`, `(1,11)`, `(2,10)-(2,11)`, `(3,11)`, and `(4,11)` form a region along the right edge, bounded by `5`s on the Left.

It remains `0`.\n    *   The region in the middle bottom (col 6, rows 2-4) is enclosed on Top, Left, and Right, but open to the Bottom.
