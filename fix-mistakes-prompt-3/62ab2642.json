There is a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output. Now the test input differs slightly from the train input. Ideally a generalised transformation should have been applied to the test input to generate the test output. But the puzzle solver got confused and made a mistake. Figure out the mistake and generate the correct test output by correcting the mistake and applying the generalised transformation.\n\nRespond in the format of the output grids\n\n--Training Examples--\n--Example 0-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [5, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [5, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [5, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n [5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [5, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [5, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [5, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 8],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 8],\n [0, 5, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 5, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 8],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n [5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n--Example 1-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8],\n [5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n--Example 2-- \n\nINPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOUTPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 5, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 7, 7, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n\n--End of Training Examples--\n\n--Test Example--\n\n INPUT: \n\n[\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n]\n\nWRONG OUTPUT:\n\n[\n [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 8],\n [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 5, 5, 7, 5, 5, 8],\n [5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8],\n [7, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8],\n [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 5, 8]\n]\n\n--End of Test Examples--\n\nYour response:"
