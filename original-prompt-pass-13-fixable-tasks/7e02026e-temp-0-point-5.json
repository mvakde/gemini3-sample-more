        "raw_text": "The pattern identified from the training examples is as follows:\n1.  **Identify \"Cross Centers\"**: Find every pixel $(r, c)$ in the input grid such that the pixel itself is `0` (black) and all four of its cardinal neighbors (up, down, left, right) are also `0`.\n    *   Condition: `Input[r][c] == 0` AND `Input[r-1][c] == 0` AND `Input[r+1][c] == 0` AND `Input[r][c-1] == 0` AND `Input[r][c+1] == 0`.\n    *   Boundary pixels are treated as non-zero (or simply cannot be centers).\n2.  **Apply Transformation**: For every such identified center $(r, c)$, change the color of the center pixel and its four neighbors to `3` (green) in the output grid.\n    *   This effectively stamps a \"cross\" shape of 3s onto the grid.\n    *   If multiple crosses overlap, the union of the 3s forms the final shape (e.g., the larger blobs in Examples 1 and 2).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nWe scan the test input for such centers:\n*   **Row 2, Column 5**: `Input[2][5]` is `0`.\n    *   Up `Input[1][5]` is `0`.\n    *   Down `Input[3][5]` is `0`.\n    *   Left `Input[2][4]` is `0`.\n    *   Right `Input[2][6]` is `0`.\n    *   All conditions met. $(2, 5)$ is a center.\n*   No other pixels satisfy the condition. For example:\n    *   $(1, 5)$ has Up `Input[0][5]` as `8`.\n    *   $(3, 5)$ has Down `Input[4][5]` as `8`.\n    *   $(2, 4)$ has Left `Input[2][3]` as `8`.\n    *   $(2, 6)$ has Right `Input[2][7]` as `8`.\n    *   Other clusters of 0s (like at row 5, col 1; or row 9, col 5) do not form a complete cross of 0s.\n\n**Transformation:**\nWe apply the cross stamp at center $(2, 5)$.\n*   $(2, 5)$ becomes `3`.\n*   $(1, 5)$ becomes `3`.\n*   $(3, 5)$ becomes `3`.\n*   $(2, 4)$ becomes `3`.\n*   $(2, 6)$ becomes `3`.\n\nAll other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\n[[8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]",
