              "content": "Based on the analysis of the training examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the block of '8's in the input grid. This block defines the dimensions and position of the output. In the Test Input, the '8's are located in rows 14 to 22 and columns 0 to 2. Thus, the output will be a 9x3 grid.\n2.  **Row Mapping:** For each cell $(r, c)$ in the target region, the value is determined by the row $R = 31 - r$ (using 1-based indexing sum of 32, or 0-based sum of indices = 31).\n3.  **Handling Occlusion:**\n    *   If the source row $R$ does *not* contain '8's in the target columns, copy the value from $(R, c)$.\n    *   If the source row $R$ *does* contain '8's (which happens when the target region overlaps with its reflection), use the value from the symmetric column in the same row. For a column $c$ in a 30-width grid (0-29), the symmetric column is $29-c$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe output corresponds to rows 14-22, columns 0-2.\n*   **Row 18 (Output Row 4):** Maps to Row $31-18 = 13$. Row 13 is clean.\n    Row 13 cols 0-2: `[4, 4, 7]`.\n*   **Row 19 (Output Row 5):** Maps to Row $31-19 = 12$. Row 12 is clean.\n    Row 12 cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 1]`.\n*   **Row 20 (Output Row 6):** Maps to Row $31-20 = 11$. Row 11 is clean.\n    Row 11 cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 6]`.\n*   **Row 21 (Output Row 7):** Maps to Row $31-21 = 10$. Row 10 is clean.\n    Row 10 cols 0-2: `[1, 6, 1]`.\n*   **Row 22 (Output Row 8):** Maps to Row $31-22 = 9$. Row 9 is clean.\n    Row 9 cols 0-2: `[6, 6, 5]`.\n\nFor the overlapping rows (14-17), we use the symmetric columns (29, 28, 27) corresponding to 0, 1, 2.\n*   **Row 14 (Output Row 0):** Maps to Row 17 (which has 8s).

This block defines the dimensions and position of the output. In the Test Input, the '8's are located in rows 14 to 22 and columns 0 to 2. Thus, the output will be a 9x3 grid.\n2.  **Row Mapping:** For each cell $(r, c)$ in the target region, the value is determined by the row $R = 31 - r$ (using 1-based indexing sum of 32, or 0-based sum of indices = 31).\n3.  **Handling Occlusion:**\n    *   If the source row $R$ does *not* contain '8's in the target columns, copy the value from $(R, c)$.\n    *   If the source row $R$ *does* contain '8's (which happens when the target region overlaps with its reflection), use the value from the symmetric column in the same row. For a column $c$ in a 30-width grid (0-29), the symmetric column is $29-c$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe output corresponds to rows 14-22, columns 0-2.\n*   **Row 18 (Output Row 4):** Maps to Row $31-18 = 13$.

The goal is to determine the values that \"should\" be in these positions.\n2.  **Find Matching Rows:** The grid contains pairs of rows that are identical (or reflections, though in these examples they are identical). Specifically, for a grid of 30 rows indexed 0-29, the row at index `i` is typically paired with the row at index `31 - i`.\n    *   For the rows containing the block of `8`s, find their partner row.\n    *   If the partner row is \"clean\" (does not contain `8`s), copy the values from the partner row at the corresponding columns.\n    *   If the partner row also contains `8`s (which happens when rows pair with each other within the block), look for \"Orphan\" rows (rows 0 and 1 usually) that haven't been paired. Map the outer self-paired rows to the outer orphan row, and the inner self-paired rows to the inner orphan row.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Locate 8s:** The `8`s appear in rows 14 through 22 (9 rows) and columns 0 through 2 (3 columns).\n    *   Row 14: `[8, 8, 8, 1, ...]`\n    *   ...\n    *   Row 22: `[8, 8, 8, 5, ...]`\n*   **Pairing and Extraction:**\n    *   Row 22 (index 22) pairs with Row 9 (31 - 22 = 9). Row 9 is `[1, 6, 1, 5, ...]`. Values at cols 0-2: **`[1, 6, 1]`**.\n    *   Row 21 (index 21) pairs with Row 10 (31 - 21 = 10). Row 10 is `[6, 6, 6, 6, ...]`. Values at cols 0-2: **`[6, 6, 6]`**.\n    *   Row 20 (index 20) pairs with Row 11 (31 - 20 = 11). Row 11 is `[6, 6, 1, 6, ...]`. Values at cols 0-2: **`[6, 6, 1]`**.\n    *   Row 19 (index 19) pairs with Row 12 (31 - 19 = 12). Row 12 is `[4, 4, 7, 7, ...]`. Values at cols 0-2: **`[4, 4, 7]`**.\n    *   Row 18 (index 18) pairs with Row 13 (31 - 18 = 13). Row 13 is `[4, 4, 7, 2, ...]`. Values at cols 0-2: **`[4, 4, 7]`**.\n    *   Row 17 (index 17) pairs with Row 14 (31 - 17 = 14). Both have `8`s.\n    *   Row 16 (index 16) pairs with Row 15 (31 - 16 = 15). Both have `8`s.\n    *   Row 15 pairs with Row 16.\n    *   Row 14 pairs with Row 17.\n\n*   **Resolving Self-Pairs (Rows 14-17):**\n    *   We use the unused rows 0 and 1.\n    *   Row 0: `[4, 4, 1, ...]`\n    *   Row 1: `[4, 4, 3, ...]`\n    *   Row 14 (outermost of the conflict) takes from Row 0: **`[4, 4, 1]`**.\n    *   Row 17 (mirror of 14) takes from Row 0: **`[4, 4, 1]`**.\n    *   Row 15 (innermost of the conflict) takes from Row 1: **`[4, 4, 3]`**.\n    *   Row 16 (mirror of 15) takes from Row 1: **`[4, 4, 3]`**.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n[[4, 4, 1], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 1], [4, 4, 7], [4, 4, 7], [6, 6, 1], [6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1]]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[[4, 4, 1], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 1], [4, 4, 7], [4, 4, 7], [6, 6, 1], [6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1]]",
