              "content": "The input grid contains regions of 0s separated by patterns of 1s. Some non-zero numbers (seeds) are placed in the grid. These seeds indicate the color of the region they occupy. The goal is to fill the 0s with the color of the nearest seed (using a geodesic/grid distance that respects 1s as initial obstacles but seeds as sources). The 1s (walls) themselves are then colored based on the color of the region they bound, typically taking the color of the \"Inner\" or \"enclosed\" region, or simply the closest seed's color if separating similar region types.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  **Bottom Area (Rows 10-12):** Seed `4` is at (11,3). It fills the large bottom area below the wall at Row 9. However, the wall at Row 9 ends at column 11, leaving column 12 open. Seed `6` at (7,11) is close to this gap. The bottom-right column (Col 12) is closer to `6` (Dist ~4-5) than to `4` (Dist ~9). So the right edge of rows 10-12 will be `6`. The rest is `4`.\n2.  **Row 9 (Wall):** Separates the bottom `4` region from the upper regions. The left part is under region `7` (centered at 4,2), but `4` is spatially closer (Dist 2 vs Dist 5). So the left part of Wall 9 is `4`. The right part is under region `8` (centered at 5,9) and `6` (7,11). `8` is closer to the wall (Dist ~4) than `4` (Dist ~8) in that segment. `6` is even closer to the end (Dist 2). So Wall 9 transitions `4 -> 8 -> 6`.\n3.  **Middle-Left (Region 7):** Seed `7` at (4,2). Enclosed by walls. Fills its box (Rows 4-8, Cols 0-5 roughly). Walls bounding it become `7`.\n4.  **Middle-Right (Region 8):** Seed `8` at (5,9). Enclosed by walls. Fills its box (Rows ~3-8, Cols ~8-10). Walls bounding it become `8`.\n5.  **Right Edge (Region 6):** Seed `6` at (7,11). Fills column 11-12 area above Row 9. Walls bounding it become `6`.\n6.  **Top Areas (Region 5 & 3):** Seeds `5`(0,1) and `3`(0,3). They are \"Background\" / Outer seeds. They fill Rows 0-2 and the spaces between the \"Inner\" boxes of 7 and 8. They split the space based on distance (midpoint between y=1 and y=3 is y=2).\n\n**Detailed Logic Application:**\n*   **Rows 0-2:** 5 and 3 fill. Split at col 2.\n*   **Rows 3-8 (Left):** 7 fills inside its box. Walls become 7.\n*   **Rows 3-8 (Right):** 8 fills inside its box. Walls become 8.\n*   **Rows 3-8 (Far Right):** 6 fills.\n*   **Walls:**\n    *   Row 9 line: 4s on left, 8s/6s on right.\n    *   Vertical walls for box 7: become 7.\n    *   Vertical walls for box 8: become 8.\n    *   Upper walls for box 7 (Row 3): 7 dominates (Interior) vs 5/3 (Exterior).

        "raw_text": "The input grid contains regions of 0s separated by patterns of 1s. Some non-zero numbers (seeds) are placed in the grid. These seeds indicate the color of the region they occupy. The goal is to fill the 0s with the color of the nearest seed (using a geodesic/grid distance that respects 1s as initial obstacles but seeds as sources). The 1s (walls) themselves are then colored based on the color of the region they bound, typically taking the color of the \"Inner\" or \"enclosed\" region, or simply the closest seed's color if separating similar region types.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  **Bottom Area (Rows 10-12):** Seed `4` is at (11,3). It fills the large bottom area below the wall at Row 9. However, the wall at Row 9 ends at column 11, leaving column 12 open. Seed `6` at (7,11) is close to this gap. The bottom-right column (Col 12) is closer to `6` (Dist ~4-5) than to `4` (Dist ~9). So the right edge of rows 10-12 will be `6`. The rest is `4`.\n2.  **Row 9 (Wall):** Separates the bottom `4` region from the upper regions. The left part is under region `7` (centered at 4,2), but `4` is spatially closer (Dist 2 vs Dist 5). So the left part of Wall 9 is `4`. The right part is under region `8` (centered at 5,9) and `6` (7,11). `8` is closer to the wall (Dist ~4) than `4` (Dist ~8) in that segment. `6` is even closer to the end (Dist 2). So Wall 9 transitions `4 -> 8 -> 6`.\n3.  **Middle-Left (Region 7):** Seed `7` at (4,2). Enclosed by walls. Fills its box (Rows 4-8, Cols 0-5 roughly). Walls bounding it become `7`.\n4.  **Middle-Right (Region 8):** Seed `8` at (5,9). Enclosed by walls. Fills its box (Rows ~3-8, Cols ~8-10). Walls bounding it become `8`.\n5.  **Right Edge (Region 6):** Seed `6` at (7,11). Fills column 11-12 area above Row 9. Walls bounding it become `6`.\n6.  **Top Areas (Region 5 & 3):** Seeds `5`(0,1) and `3`(0,3). They are \"Background\" / Outer seeds. They fill Rows 0-2 and the spaces between the \"Inner\" boxes of 7 and 8. They split the space based on distance (midpoint between y=1 and y=3 is y=2).\n\n**Detailed Logic Application:**\n*   **Rows 0-2:** 5 and 3 fill. Split at col 2.\n*   **Rows 3-8 (Left):** 7 fills inside its box. Walls become 7.\n*   **Rows 3-8 (Right):** 8 fills inside its box. Walls become 8.\n*   **Rows 3-8 (Far Right):** 6 fills.\n*   **Walls:**\n    *   Row 9 line: 4s on left, 8s/6s on right.\n    *   Vertical walls for box 7: become 7.\n    *   Vertical walls for box 8: become 8.\n    *   Upper walls for box 7 (Row 3): 7 dominates (Interior) vs 5/3 (Exterior).

              "content": "The transformation pattern is as follows:\n1.  The grid is partitioned into regions bounded by **grid edges** and lines of **digits that act as walls**. In the training examples, the digit `1` acts as an uncolored wall.\n2.  Inside each region, there are one or more **\"seed\" pixels** (non-zero, non-one digits).\n3.  Each region of empty space (`0`s) is filled with the color of the seed contained within it. If a region contains multiple seeds, they compete to fill the space based on **proximity** (Voronoi partition), although stronger connectivity/region geometry can dominate.\n4.  The **wall pixels themselves (`1`s)** are then colored. A wall pixel takes the color of the neighboring region it borders. If it borders multiple regions, it generally takes the color of the closest seed, or the region that \"encloses\" or \"owns\" the wall structure (often determined by distance to the seed).\n5.  The final output contains no `0`s or `1`s; the entire grid is filled with the seed colors.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\n**Seeds and Regions:**\n*   **5** at `(0, 1)`: Dominates the top-left corner, bounded by walls in row 3.\n*   **3** at `(0, 3)`: Dominates the top-right area. Boundary with 5 is around column 2.\n*   **7** at `(4, 2)`: Dominates the middle-left area. Bounded by walls in row 3 (top) and row 9 (bottom).\n*   **8** at `(5, 9)`: Dominates the middle-right vertical channel.\n*   **4** at `(11, 3)`: Dominates the bottom-left area.\n*   **6** at `(7, 11)`: Dominates the bottom-right area and pushes up into the middle-right below the 8 region.\n\n**Boundary Logic:**\n*   **Row 3 Walls (C0-C2):** Separate region 5 (top) and 7 (bottom). Closer to 7 (dist 1 vs 2), become **7**.\n*   **Row 2 Walls (C2-C3):** Bound 5 and 3. Become **5** or **3**. Closer to 5 and 7. Given 5 fills (0-1), and 3 fills (3-onwards), likely **5**.\n*   **Row 9 Walls:** Continuous line. Left part sits between 7 and 4 (closer to 4?). Right part sits between 8 and 6 (closer to 6). Wait, Row 9 separates region 7/4? No, 4 is at Row 11, 7 is at Row 4. Row 8/9 is boundary. Row 9 becomes **4** on left and **6** on right.\n\n**Fill Execution:**\n*   **Region 5:** `(0,0)-(1,2)` and `(2,0-1)`.\n*   **Region 3:** `(0,3)-(1,12)`, `(2,4-6)`, `(2,11-12)`. Walls at R1 take 3.\n*   **Region 7:** `(3,0-5)` (overwriting R3 walls as 7), `(4,0-7)`, `(5,0-7)`, `(6,0-7)`, `(7,0-5)`. Note: Vertical boundary with region 8/6 is enforced by walls at C7/C8.\n*   **Region 8:** Vertical strip roughly Col 8-10 in Rows 2-6.\n*   **Region 6:** Takes over bottom right `(7,6-12)` down to `(12,12)`. Pushes up against 8.

The final output fills the grid with the values of these markers.\n2.  **Walls:** The value `1` represents a barrier.\n3.  **Filling Rule:** Each cell (0 or 1) in the grid is assigned the value of the \"closest\" marker.\n    *   **Distance Metric:** The distance is not straight-line (Euclidean) or simple grid steps (Manhattan) ignoring obstacles. Instead, it is a **pathfinding distance** (geodesic distance) where `1`s act as high-cost zones or barriers that divert the path.\n    *   However, walls themselves eventually get colored.

This effectively isolates the bottom rows (11, 12) and part of row 10 for Marker `4`, preventing markers `5, 3, 7, 8` from expanding downwards, and preventing `4` from expanding upwards, except via the gap at column 12.\n\n**Simulated Filling:**\n1.  **Region 4 (Bottom):** Dominates Rows 11 and 12 and most of the Wall at Row 10.
