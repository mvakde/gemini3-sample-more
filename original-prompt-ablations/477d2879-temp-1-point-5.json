              "content": "The input images contain grids with '0's (empty space), '1's (walls), and other digits (seeds).\nThe pattern is a region-filling or flood-fill process with the following rules:\n1.  **Wall Coloring**: First, the networks of '1's (walls) are colored. A connected component of walls takes the color of a seed \"embedded\" in it. A seed is embedded if it has at least 2 adjacent wall neighbors (or is part of the wall structure).\n    -   In the test input, Seed 6 at (7, 11) neighbors walls at (6, 11) and (8, 11). Thus, the entire connected wall network (which includes the vertical line at 11, the loop at the top right, the walls at row 9, row 7, etc.) becomes **6**.\n    -   Seed 7 at (4, 2) neighbors the isolated wall cluster at top-left (Row 3 walls). Though not strictly embedded by 2 neighbors, in the absence of other seeds, these walls ((3,0), (3,1), (3,2) and neighbors (2,2)) take the color **7**.\n    -   Seed 3 at (0, 3) neighbors wall (1, 3). This wall segment ((1,3), (2,3)) takes color **3**.\n    -   Other walls are part of the 6-network.\n\n2.  **Region Filling**: The '0' cells are filled by the color of the seed (or colored wall) present in their connected region. If multiple seeds are in the same region, they fill based on proximity (Voronoi tessellation).\n    -   **Region 8**: The \"room\" enclosed by walls at cols 7 and 11, and rows 3/9 contains Seed 8 at (5, 9). This entire room fills with **8**.\n    -   **Region 4**: The area below Row 9 (col 0-10 roughly) contains Seed 4 at (11, 3). Fills with **4**.\n    -   **Region 7**: The area left of Col 7 and between Row 3 and Row 9 contains Seed 7 at (4, 2). Fills with **7**.\n    -   **Region 5**: Top-left corner (Cols 0-1, Rows 0-2) contains Seed 5 at (0, 1). Fills with **5**.\n    -   **Region 3**: Top area (Cols 2-6+, Rows 0-2) contains Seed 3 at (0, 3). Fills with **3**.\n    -   **Region 6**: The column 12 is connected to Seed 6 area and 4 is far. Fills with **6**.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seed 5 (0, 1)**: Fills (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,0)-(1,1), (2,0)-(2,1).\n*   **Seed 3 (0, 3)**: Fills (0,2) onwards to the right, and down to walls. Fills the gap in row 1 and row 2.\n*   **Walls Top Left**: (3,0)-(3,2) become 7. (2,2) becomes 7. (1,3), (2,3) become 3.\n*   **Seed 7 (4, 2)**: Fills the region below row 3, left of col 7. Rows 4-8, cols 0-6.\n*   **Seed 8 (5, 9)**: Fills the room cols 8-10, rows 4-8.\n*   **Walls Main**: Row 9 and the right-side structure become 6.\n*   **Seed 4 (11, 3)**: Fills rows 10-12, cols 0-10 (up to col 12 boundary).\n*   **Seed 6 (7, 11)**: Fills col 12 and col 11 walls.\n\n**Detailed Row construction:**\n*   **Row 0**: `5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3` (Split between 5 and 3).\n*   **Row 1**: `5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3` (Walls are 6, open space 3.

        "raw_text": "The input images contain grids with '0's (empty space), '1's (walls), and other digits (seeds).\nThe pattern is a region-filling or flood-fill process with the following rules:\n1.  **Wall Coloring**: First, the networks of '1's (walls) are colored. A connected component of walls takes the color of a seed \"embedded\" in it. A seed is embedded if it has at least 2 adjacent wall neighbors (or is part of the wall structure).\n    -   In the test input, Seed 6 at (7, 11) neighbors walls at (6, 11) and (8, 11). Thus, the entire connected wall network (which includes the vertical line at 11, the loop at the top right, the walls at row 9, row 7, etc.) becomes **6**.\n    -   Seed 7 at (4, 2) neighbors the isolated wall cluster at top-left (Row 3 walls). Though not strictly embedded by 2 neighbors, in the absence of other seeds, these walls ((3,0), (3,1), (3,2) and neighbors (2,2)) take the color **7**.\n    -   Seed 3 at (0, 3) neighbors wall (1, 3). This wall segment ((1,3), (2,3)) takes color **3**.\n    -   Other walls are part of the 6-network.\n\n2.  **Region Filling**: The '0' cells are filled by the color of the seed (or colored wall) present in their connected region. If multiple seeds are in the same region, they fill based on proximity (Voronoi tessellation).\n    -   **Region 8**: The \"room\" enclosed by walls at cols 7 and 11, and rows 3/9 contains Seed 8 at (5, 9). This entire room fills with **8**.\n    -   **Region 4**: The area below Row 9 (col 0-10 roughly) contains Seed 4 at (11, 3). Fills with **4**.\n    -   **Region 7**: The area left of Col 7 and between Row 3 and Row 9 contains Seed 7 at (4, 2). Fills with **7**.\n    -   **Region 5**: Top-left corner (Cols 0-1, Rows 0-2) contains Seed 5 at (0, 1). Fills with **5**.\n    -   **Region 3**: Top area (Cols 2-6+, Rows 0-2) contains Seed 3 at (0, 3). Fills with **3**.\n    -   **Region 6**: The column 12 is connected to Seed 6 area and 4 is far. Fills with **6**.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Seed 5 (0, 1)**: Fills (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,0)-(1,1), (2,0)-(2,1).\n*   **Seed 3 (0, 3)**: Fills (0,2) onwards to the right, and down to walls. Fills the gap in row 1 and row 2.\n*   **Walls Top Left**: (3,0)-(3,2) become 7. (2,2) becomes 7. (1,3), (2,3) become 3.\n*   **Seed 7 (4, 2)**: Fills the region below row 3, left of col 7.

So bottom of inside loop is 6.\n\nFinal Grid Representation:\n\n```\n[[5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], \n [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]\n```",

The goal is to fill the background (0s) and color the walls based on the seeds.\n\n**Pattern Identified:**\n1.  **Classify 1s:** The `1` cells form connected components (using 4-way connectivity). Each component is assigned a color based on the \"Seed\" it is connected to.\n    *   A component takes the color of a Seed if it is adjacent to it.\n    *   In Example 0, the loop of 1s touches Seed 2 and becomes color 2.\n    *   In Example 1, the component `C1` touches Seed 3 and becomes 3. The component `C2` touches Seeds 8 and 6; it has more contacts with 8, so it becomes 8.\n    *   The Test Input has two main components of 1s:\n        *   **Left Blob (LB):** Includes `(1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`. It touches Seed 3 `(0,3)` and Seed 7 `(4,2)`. Based on heuristic (7 is \"inside\" / more enclosed contacts), LB becomes **7**.\n        *   **Right Blob + Bottom (RB):** Includes the large structure on the right and the bottom line at Row 9. It connects to Seed 6 `(7,11)` (and touches others slightly less or not at all). It becomes **6**.\n2.  **Fill 0s:** The remaining 0s are filled using a nearest-neighbor logic (Voronoi/Watershed) from the \"Fixed\" cells (Seeds and the now-colored Walls).\n    *   Seeds are: 5 `(0,1)`, 3 `(0,3)`, 7 `(4,2)`, 8 `(5,9)`, 6 `(7,11)`, 4 `(11,3)`.\n    *   Colored Walls are: LB (Color 7), RB (Color 6).\n    *   Conflict Resolution:\n        *   Area top-left: Shared by 5 and 3. 5 fills left, 3 fills right.\n        *   Area inside LB and below: Filled by 7.\n        *   Area inside RB: Filled by 8.\n        *   Area below Row 9 line (left/center): Filled by 4.\n        *   Area right/outside: Filled by 6.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **LB Walls (Color 7):** `(1,3)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`.\n*   **RB Walls (Color 6):** Row 1 (6-10), Row 2 (2-3, 6, 10 -- Wait, R2 2,3 is LB), Row 2 (6, 10), Row 3 (6, 7, 10, 11), Rows 4-6 (7, 11), Row 7 (5, 6, 7), Row 8 (5, 11), Row 9 (0-10).\n\n**Predicted Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Region 5 (Top Left):** Around `(0,1)`.

LB walls themselves are 7.\n*   **Region 8 (Right Mid):** Inside the RB loop. Seed `(5,9)` fills `(4,9)`, `(5,8)-(5,10)`, `(6,9)`. Bounded by RB (6).\n*   **Region 6 (Right/Bottom):** RB walls are 6. R9 line is 6. Area to the right fills with 6. Area `(9,11)` is part of R9 line.\n*   **Region 4 (Bottom Left):** Below R9 line (Row 10, 11, 12). Seed `(11,3)`.

        "raw_text": "The input grid contains \"seeds\" (integers > 1) and \"walls\" (integers = 1). The goal is to fill the background (0s) and color the walls based on the seeds.\n\n**Pattern Identified:**\n1.  **Classify 1s:** The `1` cells form connected components (using 4-way connectivity). Each component is assigned a color based on the \"Seed\" it is connected to.\n    *   A component takes the color of a Seed if it is adjacent to it.\n    *   In Example 0, the loop of 1s touches Seed 2 and becomes color 2.\n    *   In Example 1, the component `C1` touches Seed 3 and becomes 3. The component `C2` touches Seeds 8 and 6; it has more contacts with 8, so it becomes 8.\n    *   The Test Input has two main components of 1s:\n        *   **Left Blob (LB):** Includes `(1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`. It touches Seed 3 `(0,3)` and Seed 7 `(4,2)`. Based on heuristic (7 is \"inside\" / more enclosed contacts), LB becomes **7**.\n        *   **Right Blob + Bottom (RB):** Includes the large structure on the right and the bottom line at Row 9. It connects to Seed 6 `(7,11)` (and touches others slightly less or not at all). It becomes **6**.\n2.  **Fill 0s:** The remaining 0s are filled using a nearest-neighbor logic (Voronoi/Watershed) from the \"Fixed\" cells (Seeds and the now-colored Walls).\n    *   Seeds are: 5 `(0,1)`, 3 `(0,3)`, 7 `(4,2)`, 8 `(5,9)`, 6 `(7,11)`, 4 `(11,3)`.\n    *   Colored Walls are: LB (Color 7), RB (Color 6).\n    *   Conflict Resolution:\n        *   Area top-left: Shared by 5 and 3. 5 fills left, 3 fills right.\n        *   Area inside LB and below: Filled by 7.\n        *   Area inside RB: Filled by 8.\n        *   Area below Row 9 line (left/center): Filled by 4.\n        *   Area right/outside: Filled by 6.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **LB Walls (Color 7):** `(1,3)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, `(3,0)`, `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`.\n*   **RB Walls (Color 6):** Row 1 (6-10), Row 2 (2-3, 6, 10 -- Wait, R2 2,3 is LB), Row 2 (6, 10), Row 3 (6, 7, 10, 11), Rows 4-6 (7, 11), Row 7 (5, 6, 7), Row 8 (5, 11), Row 9 (0-10).\n\n**Predicted Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Region 5 (Top Left):** Around `(0,1)`. Fills `(0,0)-(0,2)`, `(1,0)-(1,2)`.\n*   **Region 3 (Top Mid):** Around `(0,3)`. Fills `(0,3)-(0,7)`, `(1,4)-(1,5)`. Boundary with 6 (RB) on right.\n*   **Region 7 (Left Mid):** Bounded by LB walls (which are 7) and R9 line (which is 6). Seed `(4,2)` fills the pocket. LB walls themselves are 7.\n*   **Region 8 (Right Mid):** Inside the RB loop. Seed `(5,9)` fills `(4,9)`, `(5,8)-(5,10)`, `(6,9)`. Bounded by RB (6).\n*   **Region 6 (Right/Bottom):** RB walls are 6. R9 line is 6. Area to the right fills with 6. Area `(9,11)` is part of R9 line.\n*   **Region 4 (Bottom Left):** Below R9 line (Row 10, 11, 12). Seed `(11,3)`. Fills the rectangular area below the 6-wall at R9.\n\n**Final Grid Values:**\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 7, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\nWait, looking at Row 9 input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`. All 1s except col 12. This wall is 6.\nSo Row 9 output is `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` (Col 12 fills with 6).\nRow 10-12 below the wall: Seed 4 is at (11,3). Fills everything up to any boundaries.\nCol 8, 11 in rows 10-12 are ... wait.\nInput `1`s in test: R8 `...1...` (11). R10 `...1...` (8)? R11 `...1...` (7,8).\nLet's recheck R10, R11 1s.\nR10: `0...1...` (8).\nR11: `0...4...0,1,1,0`. (7,8).\nR12: `...1...` (7).\nAre these 1s connected to RB (6)?\nR10(8) adj R9(8)-1(6). Yes.\nR11(8) adj R10(8). Yes.\nR11(7) adj R11(8). Yes.\nR12(7) adj R11(7). Yes.\nSo all these 1s become 6.\nSeed 4 is at (11,3).\nIt fills R10-12 cols 0-6 approx.\nCols 7,8 are 6.\nRight of col 8? R10-12 cols 9+.\nOpen to Seed 6 (top right)? Or Seed 4?\nCol 9 is 0. Adjacent to 8 (6). Adjacent to 9 (6-row9).\nSeed 6 is far. Seed 4 is blocked by walls at 7,8.\nActually 6-walls surround the bottom right pocket?\nR9 is 6. R10(8), R11(7,8), R12(7) are 6.\nIs there a wall at col 11? R8(11)-1.\nR9(11)-1. R10(11)? No.\nSo bottom right is open to bottom?\nIf so, nearest seed takes it.\n(11,9) dist to 6-wall (at 11,8) is 1.\nDist to Seed 4 (11,3) is blocked? No, straight line blocked by wall?\nWall at 7,8 blocks 3 from 9.\nSo 4 cannot reach bottom right easily.\nWall 6 is Source. Fills bottom right with 6.\n\nRefined Output:\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 7, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]\n\n[[5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 7, 7, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]",
