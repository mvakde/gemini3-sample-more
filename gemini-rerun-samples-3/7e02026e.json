If multiple plus shapes overlap, all involved cells become `3`.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Center at (2, 5):** The cell at row 2, column 5 is `0`. Its neighbors (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6) are all `0`. This forms a plus shape. The \"Wrong Output\" correctly identified this.\n2.  **Centers at (9, 1) and (9, 2):**\n    *   (9, 1) is `0` with neighbors (8,1), (10,1), (9,0), (9,2) all `0`.\n    *   (9, 2) is `0` with neighbors (8,2), (10,2), (9,1), (9,3) all `0`.\n    *   These form two overlapping plus shapes. The \"Wrong Output\" correctly identified these.\n3.  **Center at (5, 9):**\n    *   The cell at row 5, column 9 is `0`.\n    *   Up (4, 9) is `0`.\n    *   Down (6, 9) is `0`.\n    *   Left (5, 8) is `0`.\n    *   Right (5, 10) is `0`.\n    *   This forms a valid plus shape. **The \"Wrong Output\" missed this shape entirely.**\n\n**Correction:**\nI need to add the green plus shape centered at (5, 9) to the output. This involves changing (5,9) and its neighbors (4,9), (6,9), (5,8), and (5,10) to `3`.\n\n**Correct Output Grid:**\n\n```json\n[\n [8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],\n [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n```",
